            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Booke of Psalmes is most excellent aboue the weight in golde, worthy of all to be known and learned by hart. Wherin are written of Christ, (in whom are all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of wisedome and knowledge. Col. 2.2.) Luke. 24.44. as Peter to the end quoteth it, Acts. 1.20. and also Paule, Acts, 13.33. the authoritie whereof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Christ himselfe vseth, Luke, 20.42. VVhereof, what the godly learned in former times haue thought, it were too long to write, and may bee offensiue in regarde of the excessiue commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aboue the rest: &amp; euen of late, that noble men may finde some worth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the right illustrious and godly Father of <hi>Iohn Casimer,</hi> Countie Palatine of Rhene, thought good to haue it transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alone into the Dutch tongue, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with him in his bosome as a fittest
<pb facs="tcp:14909:4"/>companion, and to giue to euery of his seruaunts to read and learne them. Not onely so, but before him, <hi>Cosmas</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious &amp; holy Bishop of Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, seeing many things to displease him, and that without hope of redresse, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouer his rochet of his own accord, departed the Citty, and bad his seruaunt to carry away nothing of all the great goods gotten in his Sea, saue the Psalter of Dauid. Hee iudged no viands for a Christian Pilgrime so sufficient as thys one Booke, being as indeede a wise and learned Father calleth it, The common treasure-house of all good instructions. So as whosoeuer shall not highly make account heereof, displeaseth God, and hurteth himselfe.</p>
               <p>Nowe, though this Booke bee like a precious boxe of pearles wherein none can displease, yet for some purposes, one may be fitter then another: exercises of conscience in the case of turning first to God, or quickning and increasing that, are specially to be followed. Such is thys Psalme, hauing more varietie of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary matter, then any so small scripture
<pb facs="tcp:14909:4"/>that I know, being (as a man may terme it) a conscience or practical Catechisme, so suting these times, &amp; especially Gods chyldren in them, as that I would wish them, when they meane to stirre the wheeles of all good graces in them, to vse this Psalme, as <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene</hi> did the Lamentations of Ieremy when he meant to mourne.</p>
               <p>But it is best to heare the psalm speak for it selfe, both in the inscription and treatise.</p>
               <p>The inscription is for, or to the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Musicke, a psalme of Dauid. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And containeth in it, fiue especiall thinges, 1. the party to whom it was cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, 2. the kind of treatise, 3. the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, 4. the time, 5. the occasion.</p>
               <p>The party to whom it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is in the Hebrew <hi>Lamnatsea,</hi> for the meaning whereof the learned doe not accord. Some expound it, him that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth or ouercōmeth, viz. in singing. Others, the Maister of the cōsort quire, or musicke, in such a kinde &amp; course. What it is, wee may better vnderstand
<pb facs="tcp:14909:5"/>by the 1. Cro. 15.21. <hi>Mattithia, Eliphelah</hi> and others, were set ouer the basse &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, for that is the <hi>Sheminith,</hi> that is, the eighth or diapason, as the Musitions cal it. Where by the way, we may perceiue, that the godly learned Interpreters at <hi>Genua,</hi> mistooke that <hi>Lamnatsea</hi> as it is in the Hebrew, &amp; haue in theyr transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made it a proper name, <hi>Lenazziah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it was: The Musitians by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid and Salomon, afterward were deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into companies and courses, as may appeare, 1. Cro. 25. the chiefe of which company was called as heere, hee that excelleth, that is, in that companie and kinde of Musicke, some-what like the Chanter or Maister of the Children in Cathedrall Churches. Hence it is, that some psalmes are to <hi>Ieduthun,</hi> to <hi>Corah,</hi> that is, committed to them.</p>
               <p>Now they were committed to them, to appoynt the musicke for the singing of them, a shadow whereof, is in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of seruices in Cathedrall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Looke 1. Cron. 16.7. So as, that they were cōmitted to them for others, euen as Christ sendeth to the Angels,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:5"/>Reue. 2.3. that is, the Pastours for the whole people and Church: So doe the Prophets prophesie against some, and yet for the people.</p>
               <p>All this was doone as a part of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne worship of God to continue.</p>
               <p>Whereby wee may learne, that the Booke of Psalmes is scripture inspired by God, contayning instruction for the people of GOD. This may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the Psalme for the Sabboth, which is 92. by the 113.14.15.16.17. psalmes, which the Iewes call the <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luiah,</hi> and were sung at the Passeouer, &amp; are that hymne or song which is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Gospell, &amp; also by other moe: insomuch as that sometime in the person of Dauid, Christ and the church are to be considered of vs.</p>
               <p>Further, such psalmes were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to these Maisters of the musicke, to require other to sing them. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. Collo. 3.16. requireth that vvee should speake vnto our selues, that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our selues, one to another in psalmes and hymnes, so as that it may be a great shame to vs, if not staying all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldrie
<pb facs="tcp:14909:6"/>songs and vaine Sonnets, vvee procure not euen of others the Psalmes to be sunge. Dauid would not els so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten haue made it his exercise, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked other thereto. And for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter directing our singing, wee must doe it with vnderstanding, Psal. 47.8. that is, first that our selues may vnderstand, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, wee were as good to sol fa, or sound as organes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we be with companie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers must vnderstand vs, 1. Cor. 14.15. &amp; so must they vnderstand vs, that our singing may be with grace, as Colos. 3.16. ministring occasion of profitable matter and instruction in grace.</p>
               <p>Where we may see that plaine song is better for thys turne then pricke song.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it must bee doone with the hart. Colos. 3.16. with feeling, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cheerefulnes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it must be to the Lord, that is, the hart lifted vp vnto God , not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in the sounde of musicke, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the minde set vppon the matter.</p>
               <p>Hence followed, that euen in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it being to bee performed to God,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:6"/>it should be with great reuerence.</p>
               <p>But heere one may maruell, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, such a great man as hee was, whose credite ought to be deere to himselfe &amp; his people, should commit a psalme to others to be sunge, wherein his ovvne shoulde be to all posteritie proclaimed and blazoned.</p>
               <p>No doubt it is first to teach vs, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the particuler examples of the saints of God, haue vse for common instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and now in this kind of Dauids fact to learne ones owne infirmitie, how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in searching ones owne selfe, how seuere against himselfe for faults, howe desirous to rise after falls euerie one should be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that in some case, a man may acknowledge his personall faults to others, and openly.</p>
               <p>First, according as hee hath offended publiquely as Dauid did, or priuately.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when we acknowledge our owne sinnes, and Gods mercy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort others, as Paule doth of his persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to witnesse our sound and
<pb facs="tcp:14909:7"/>through turning to God, while wee are not loath to acknowledge our faules in the face of the world.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the partie to vvhom this treasure was cōmitted of trust, now followeth the kinde of the enduing, it is sayd to be a Psalme.</p>
               <p>A psalme is, when there is musicke set to a dittie. A song is (many times) mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke or noates without ditty.</p>
               <p>Dauid was wont and others to sing to theyr Harpes or Lyraes, as we are wont to play two, or three, or foure parts, and sing the fift. Thus did Lyrick Poets, <hi>Pindarus</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> make ditties for such musick.</p>
               <p>But this is the difference, Dauids mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians had the gift of prophecying, as 1. Cron. 25.1.2.3. that is, to open the Scriptures, and make godly ditties for the vse of the seruice of God, &amp; did not only make noises in the Temple or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. 1. Cro. 25.5.</p>
               <p>So as that not all kind of Singing men in Churches, haue Dauids practises for warrant thereof.</p>
               <p>The instruments and voyce vvere,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:7"/>when there had beene before some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the praysing of God, to stirre vp the people there-vnto. Looke psal. 57.9.</p>
               <p>Why then shoulde not wee by all the meanes that God affoordeth , stirre vp our dull harts to prayse him?</p>
               <p>Or shall Dauid haue such priuate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of religion, as that hee can pen mournful ditties or Elegies, and shal not vvee likewise exercise our selues vnto godlines? Sometimes searching out our sinnes &amp; bewayling them, gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the promises of God in Christ, to beleeue in them, laboring to get per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler directions for euery of our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, enrolling Gods fauours to vs, and returning prayses for them.</p>
               <p>The Author or Scribe, was Dauid a King and Prophet, bewayling his own sinnes, shewing vs, that Kinges should confesse theyr sinnes, and set themselues a part to take knowledge of them, and mourne ouer them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the breach of the word of God, is a sin in Kings as any other, so that murder, adultery, though neuer so close, swearing, breaking of the sabboth,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:8"/>pride, idlenesse, &amp;c. are sinnes in them. What King eyther of Spaine or France, would haue doone as Dauid did? But yet so he ought.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, &amp; that if Dauid who loued musicke so well, did vse it in such a holy and profitable sort, ought not we to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low such delights as we may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for?</p>
               <p>The time was, when Nathan the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had come vnto him, &amp; not before, that is, that then he penned this psalme: not that he did not before acknowledge and bewaile his sinne. For it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that a man as Dauid was, according to Gods owne hart, coulde continue so long (as some thinke Dauid did) in his sinnes without touch of hart. Looke 2. Sam. 11.27.</p>
               <p>Besides, Dauids hart smit him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently in smaller matters, as for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the people, wishing for water of the Wel of Bethlehem, cutting; of the lap of Saules garment, and therefore it is most probable it did so in this thing.</p>
               <p>Lastly, vnlesse Dauids hart had had some exercise before, it woulde hardlie
<pb facs="tcp:14909:8"/>haue yeelded so presently to Nathans reprehēsion, it was otherwise with Saul towards Samuell, with Adam and Eue to God.</p>
               <p>Well then may some say, if Dauid was touched in hart before, was it not sufficient?</p>
               <p>Answ. No, God would haue the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of blasphemie giuen to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by the death of Vriah, &amp; the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to the people by the adulterie of Bathsheba, taken away, and that Dauid should be a patterne of effectuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion to all posteritie.</p>
               <p>Where marke, that when men open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and notoriously sinne, God will haue it as openly acknowledged. Was it not thus in Manasses, Peter, Paule, &amp; diuers others.</p>
               <p>This time is set out by circumlocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vz. that it was after Nathan came vnto. &amp;c. that is, some month after his fault with Bathsheba, and vpon Vriah, according as likewise it falleth out with the chyldren of God sundry times, when they haue sinned. Many yeeres there were before Manasses was touched, and
<pb facs="tcp:14909:9"/>some month before Saint Paule was, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his persecuting.</p>
               <p>The brethren of Ioseph, long after theyr vnkindnesse to theyr brother were grieued with themselues. So that a man may be some while before he repent, &amp; he in some sinne before hee sufficientlie turne to GOD. Iehu did many good things, likewise the men that spied out the land, saue Caleb and Iosua, yet ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did all as they ought. Then hath a man true &amp; full sorrow for sin, when it is to conuersion and increasing change. This the Apostle calleth godly, other is worldly sorrow, and alwaies hath with it great care, great apollogie, indignation, feare, desire, zeale, punishment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we may speake more particulerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
               <p>Nowe Nathan went to Dauid as sent of God, 2. Sam. 12.1, not of himselfe, nor sent for by Dauid, or set on by any Courtiers or aduersaries. Some-times Kings could sende for Prophets, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat for Michaiah, Ezechiah, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiah, and this our King and Prophet to Nathan. Now Nathan is faine to come
<pb facs="tcp:14909:9"/>without sending for, and goe by Gods commaundement onely. So are all mens mindes readier to finde fauours &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, then to acknowledge and confesse theyr sinnes, not indifferently liking of the company and ministery of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but for theyr owne turnes and pleasings.</p>
               <p>Heere may we well thinke howe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than might bee discouraged, going to such a personage, in such a time, on such an arrand, as by and by wee shall heare of, yet is he not, but goeth about Gods busines, euen to the displeasing (as hee might feare) of Kings &amp; Princes. Why then should any bee so nice, to feare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes and taunts of meaner men which draw no blood.</p>
               <p>And seeing that Dauid had neede to be put in minde, who can iudge any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition sufficient for himselfe?</p>
               <p>This comming of Nathan to Dauid, is to be considered of by the intent and end, to rebuke and conuince Dauid, as may appeare by Nathans whole course, and the successe thereof.</p>
               <p>But marke I beseech you Nathans
<pb facs="tcp:14909:10"/>iudgement and behauiour. 2. Sam. 12.2. darkely he goeth about the bush, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make Dauid confesse first in the generall, then to conuince him in the particuler: fearing that if hee had gone plainly to worke, the King would not haue heard all, but cut him off in the midst, or if he had first opened the fault, and not conuinced the iudgement, it might haue cost him the setting on.</p>
               <p>Can wee but learne from hence, that indeede dangerous it is for outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state to aduertise Princes of their faults? and for all that, yet when GOD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, it must be done. Now God commaundeth all duties of our place. Thus did Iohn Baptist, Elias, &amp; others. Neither this onely, but very hard will it be to bring great ones to see their faults. Saule may teach vs this: these think not of sinnes, they thinke theyr places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them: and many such Figge leaues haue them: and many such Figge leaues haue they. Yet for all this, men must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour that such may know &amp; amende theyr faults, who sinne not alone, but by example infect others.</p>
               <p>But some man may say, VVhy vvas
<pb facs="tcp:14909:10"/>Nathan sent rather then some other?</p>
               <p>For his ministery and place, for gifts and fidelitie, as a knowne man meete to conuince a King.</p>
               <p>Where are then these Eliasses, Iohns, Latimers, and such like?</p>
               <p>Nowe marke the fruite, Dauid is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked &amp; amendeth: so doth God blesse his owne ordinances, as to Saul, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, who some what yet by rebukes were restrained. Let none therfore make doubtes in Gods busines, but go about it, and leaue the successe to him who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it.</p>
               <p>Dauid is rebuked and amendeth at a word. Heere is a difference between the rebukings to the children of God, and men vneffectually called. Gods Chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are corrected, and rebuked at and by the word. Gods workes are wont to worke more with worldlings.</p>
               <p>But put case they hearing the Word, doe feare as Herod, and Felix. &amp;c. after they forget. Gods chyldren doe hide it vp, and make it of vse, &amp; to rebuke long after that they once haue heard it.</p>
               <p>Or graunt the worldlings doe thinke
<pb facs="tcp:14909:11"/>vpon it, they are not reformed, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are.</p>
               <p>The occasion remaineth, vvhich is, both of Nathans message, and Dauids enditing this Psalme: to wit, his going in to Bathsheba. Where first marke the words, afterward the matter.</p>
               <p>The words are very graue, honest, &amp; seemely: giuing vs to take knowledge of that which is not so comely to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. This phrase is vsuall in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>It is a grace of speech, in seemly tearmes to deliuer vnseemely things. So Iob. 1.5. blessing is put for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as 1. Reg. 21.10. This is vsuall in the Scriptures, as likewise in other tongues, <hi>Eyonyma</hi> in Greeke, a good name for a thing of worse worth: <hi>Eymenides</hi> for the Furies. The olde Latines for nothing woulde say well, for no body good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and so other nations: the <hi>Tuscan Italians,</hi> call diseases which they most loath, with most fauourable names, as the Falling-sicknes, Gods disease, and such like.</p>
               <p>How ought men therfore to abstaine
<pb facs="tcp:14909:11"/>from euill deedes, when the Spirite of God forbeareth euen the ordinarie names of common sinnes?</p>
               <p>Nay, a shame shall it be for vs, not to leaue off all filthy speech, and not so much as to name with liking any sinne. Looke Exod. 23.13. Hosea. 2.17. Psal. 16.4.</p>
               <p>So that if euen for termes a man should looke to himselfe, the like care is to be had of company, recreations, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, diet, and such things wherein wee may very soone offend.</p>
               <p>The matter &amp; meaning of the phrase is, that Dauid sinned in Bathsheba, and by occasion thereof vpon Vriah, giuing likewise cause to the enemies to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</p>
               <p>O then into what fearefull sinnes may the children of God fall? to any, saue that which is the sinne against the holy Ghost, so that all the care in the world is too little to watch ouer our selues with.</p>
               <p>Againe, see howe one sinne tolleth on another. Dauid little thought of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the first, but now to seek a cloake for adultery, he will commit that, yea
<pb facs="tcp:14909:12"/>not care for the glory of God in respect of his owne credite. Doubting in Eue bred disobedience, and the misery of all man-kinde. VVherefore, resist sinne in the beginning, it wil too soone grow too strong, and draw a long taile after it.</p>
               <p>Besides consider, that Dauid had (no doubt) of his priuie chamber, whom he vsed very secretly for Bathsheba, as hee dealt with Ioab for Vriah by priuate Letters, neyther durst those parties be acknowne. Court sinnes are many times couert and cunning, and yet for all this, wee see they come and breake out.</p>
               <p>It is therefore folly, sinning to thinke to lie hid. Thou didst it secretly, (sayth Nathan to Dauid from the Lord) but I will doe this, (that is, punish thee) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Israel, and this sunne. 2. Sam 12.12. Nay Kings themselues cannot sinne without marking by God, &amp; in his time reuealing.</p>
               <p>Nowe, the partie with whom this sin was committed, is not to be neglected. Bathsheba, a vvoman not onely of a good house and place, whō Dauid the King after married, but a deuout vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:12"/>obseruing the religious seruices of God in her purification, 2. Sam. 11.2.4. Very vvise and accomplished, as may appeare by Prou. 31. which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue beene of her making, and yet shee is ouertaken to folly.</p>
               <p>Let good Ladies then take heede of daliance and courting, sooner may they be ouer-come then they thinke for, such is the poyson of euill cōpany &amp; speech, able to infect the chastest in the world.</p>
               <p>And if Dauid and Bathsheba commit folly, we need not doubt, but that there was a great deale more filthines then in the Court. So it is, some one sinne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, may make vs iudge of manie close. Reade ouer the whole eyght chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ezechiell. Where then many sins breake out, knowe that many more are committed, which should make vs to mourne at the filthines of such times.</p>
               <p>But one may say, I neuer committed adulterie, I neuer kept whore. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There is no Dauid for all that, that hath not his Bathsheba, no Bathsheba that hath not her Dauid, that is, there is none but taketh delight in some sinne
<pb facs="tcp:14909:13"/>or other. Idolatry is whoredome, so is Couetousnes. Iam. 4.4.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, let euery one seek to find out the strange flesh his soule runneth after, as his Bathsheba, which one may doe, by applying the whole Worde of God to his whole selfe: constantly stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying &amp; meditating thereupon, making more account of the witnes of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, then the iudgements of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>That shall wee finde to be our Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba or sweet sinne, which we wil least be acknowne of, as in Saule for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malikites, Herod for Herodias, and such like. So doe proude, couetous, riotous, &amp;c. persons, excuse, extenuate, or cloake theyr sinnes.</p>
               <p>Which though we take great heede, wee shall easily offend in, as that of the tongue, psalm 30.23. Iam. 3, 8. so is it for anger, in parties subiect thereto.</p>
               <p>Which enemies waite to trap vs most in, and can vp-braide vs most with, they can sooner see it then we our selues. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in euery body sootheth it selfe, and none but thinketh himselfe fayre, &amp; his
<pb facs="tcp:14909:13"/>owne breath sweete: but especially, if those whom wee iudge aduersaries are godly and wise, as Elias to Ahab, and Michaiah, Iohn to Herod, there will be no errour.</p>
               <p>Besides, in griefes of conscience, that woundeth sorest, which is frō the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most vsuall sin.</p>
               <p>And after this once found out, let him be humbled to conuersion for it, which neuer will be, till acknowledging all sin in generall, and misliking our owne knowne sinnes in speciall, wee forsake them all.</p>
               <p>Neyther let vs thinke that any sinne is small, and may be made light of.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What can be little that offendeth the infinite God?</item>
                  <item>2. That deserueth euerlasting death?</item>
                  <item>3. And if one sinne of Adams poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned (as I may say) the whole worlde, shall we nourish any?</item>
                  <item>4. Indeede, if but all the world could discharge a man but from one sinne, it were some-what.</item>
                  <item>5. Or that but one sin not remitted did not damne: but it is quite otherwise.</item>
               </list>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:14"/>
               <p>Wherefore, be perswaded your sinnes are great, els will you neuer sorrowe for them, or seeke to be eased of them: and God then will not forgiue thee.</p>
               <p>Nowe followeth the Psalme it selfe, which all is a most excellent and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary prayer, continually to be vsed for the matter of it, of all &amp; euery the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>
               <p>Whereof there are two parts: The first, generall proposition, or chiefe sum of the whole Psalme. The second is a more particuler setting down of things prayed for.</p>
               <p>The generall proposition, is to finde fauour with God, and is in the first and second verse, &amp; hath in it, first the thing prayed for: secondly, the party who is prayed vnto: thirdly, the measure of the thing prayed for.</p>
               <p>The thing it selfe is set downe in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers words, first, <hi>hauing mercy:</hi> second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>putting away iniquities:</hi> thirdly, <hi>wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from iniquitie:</hi> fourthly, <hi>clensing from sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is, <hi>hauing mercie,</hi> or shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:14909:14"/>fauour, &amp; is as much, as let me haue thy countenaunce againe, and former li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: which indeede is at the first, the roote of all good things vnto vs, which beeing renued, bringeth all good things afresh with it.</p>
               <p>Know then that you can neuer haue comfort but in the fauour of God.</p>
               <p>And that all sinne deserueth the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God.</p>
               <p>That nothing will pacifie a cōscience wounded for sinne, but onely perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fauour of God. 1. God dooth not forget sinnes: 2. they wil not vanish away of themselues: 3. neither can any merits or meanes of any creature satisfie for the least.</p>
               <p>So that we had need to make more of Gods fauour, then of all other things in the world.</p>
               <p>And the first thing a sinner feeling his sinnes is to doe, not seeking by gaming, company, or any such meanes to put thē off, but presently to flie to the fauour of God.</p>
               <p>The second manner of speech, (for I iudge it best to follow this order) is, <hi>put
<pb facs="tcp:14909:15"/>away mine iniquities.</hi> Wherein is confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fault, in the word iniquities, and crauing of pardon in desiring to haue them put away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iniquities,</hi> that is, defection or rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, properly one of the most greeuous kinde of sinnes. In deede euery sinne in some sort is so: because we owe all alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to God, and in baptisme haue all vowed it, and haue as it were done ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in yeelding obedience for a time, and haue so many meanes against sinne, as vnlesse wee purpose to rebell against God, we could not commit it.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, when some grosse sin vpon no great tentation is committed, it encreaseth the fault, so was it with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, who seeing, was snared &amp; taken.</p>
               <p>These sins, for number and greatnes are here set out; which before Nathans comming, could not be so well percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, so that a mans iudgement at all times is not the best, touching his owne estate.</p>
               <p>By Dauids example wee see, that a child of God being truly conuinced of sinne, will neuer lessen it, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<pb facs="tcp:14909:15"/>it in speech, and euen that sinne which he loued so wel, so that little sins, if God see good, shall seeme great: for when Gods iustice shall shine, and the deuil accuse, nothing can seeme small.</p>
               <p>In touch for sinne, more are Gods children greeued for their fault, than for feare of punishment.</p>
               <p>Nowe followeth crauing of pardon, <hi>put away,</hi> or blot out, which God is said to doe. Isa. 43.25. which Peter promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, Act. 3.19. and the speech is borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed from the vse of thinges chalked or scored vp, or written downe, which though they be once, and after put out, are as though they neuer had beene: therefore so prayeth Dauid, that his sins may be as if they neuer had beene: scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as the mist.</p>
               <p>This could not be, but that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet meant, that sinnes of them selues stand in a debt booke, or inuentorie till they be cancelled: for GOD taketh knowledge of them, our owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot bee ignorant, nay, many times the deuil and wicked men can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect vs for them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:16"/>
               <p>No true conuert can abide the shape of his owne sinnes, but desireth to haue them defaced, so little will hee boast of them.</p>
               <p>Yea rather would he haue them put out of the sight of God, than of all other parties in the world.</p>
               <p>The third speech followeth, <hi>Wash me from my sinnes:</hi> which how necessarie it is, appeareth in that Ezechiel vpbraideth his people with the want thereof. Ezec. 16.4.9. and Ierimias requireth it. Ier. 4.14. to bee had. The speech likewise is borrowed from things soyled, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing washed, recouer their beauty: so the conscience of man hauing pardon of sinns, hath againe his former hiew. Here is mercy on Gods part.</p>
               <p>Washing, to omit all bodily cleansing, may for this place be vnderstoode, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the washing of sanctification as is, Isa. 1.16. Pro. 30.12. or of the washing of iustification, &amp; forgiuenes of sinnes.</p>
               <p>As Christ speaketh. Iohn, 13.8.10. which I take indeed to be the Prophets meaning, because it is the first washing necessarie to saluation, vvhen as the
<pb facs="tcp:14909:16"/>blood of Christ, counted by God, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the hand of faith, cleanseth the conscience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ would haue Peter thus to be washed all ouer, head, hands, and feete, and not onely him, but as him so all and euery other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that as in the bathes they scowred downe the filth from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the feete, and then washed also and cleansed them, so we had neede that not onely grosse sinnes, but remnants thereof should more and more be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged away.</p>
               <p>So as that we may learne from hence, not to think of our sinns as small things, which the longer they cleaue vnto vs, we hauing meanes against them, and yet doe not leaue them, will cost vs more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, ere wee can fully shake them off: which as all the people of this our land, so wee of these places heere abouts, had neede think of.</p>
               <p>That as in washing much rubbing &amp; wringing is requisite, so we must know that before we can shake off the filth of sinne, many rubbings and wringings by
<pb facs="tcp:14909:17"/>afflictions must passe ouer our heads, and that we should vse our afflictions as Sope, and Lie, to scowre out the staines of sinne throughly: besides, in that the Prophet wisheth thus to be washed, he sheweth that we are not slightly blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with sinne, but that wee are quite stayned, and as it were branded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Looke Isa. 1.18. Ier. 13.2.3.</p>
               <p>And not onely so, but if he might be throughly cleansed from sinne, he careth not what befell himselfe, let him be rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, wringed, beaten, so sinne may be driuen out, it is his desire.</p>
               <p>Withall, he sheweth that he desireth not onely to haue sinne as it were sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but plucked vp by the rootes, and the spots taken away.</p>
               <p>Hee feareth least somewhat remaine vnforgiuen, &amp; filth vnwashed out, heere is feare commendable. Phil. 2.12.</p>
               <p>And beeing once washed, will neuer foule himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinnes,</hi> that is <hi>iniquitie,</hi> any thing swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from the rule of the word of God, so as that the godly alwayes examine them selues, and endeuour to fit them
<pb facs="tcp:14909:17"/>selues to the word of God.</p>
               <p>Find many faults to accuse themselues of, as may heere appeare by the sundry names of sinnes, as also Psal. 32.12. and the number vsed.</p>
               <p>The fourth speech followeth. <hi>Cleanse me from my sinne,</hi> in matter and meaning all one with the former, wherein is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise set downe the acknowledging of the fault, and the crauing of pardon.</p>
               <p>Acknowledging of the fault, is in the words, <hi>my sinne,</hi> the word in Hebrew is <hi>Kata,</hi> which signifieth a missing of the mark one should ayme at, that is so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly vsed. Iudg. 20.16. This mark is the word of God. Psa. 119.15. they that put it in Meeter thought of this. Now as he that hitteth not the marke though hee come neuer so neere faileth of his aime, so booteth it not to come neere, if wee touch not the word of God.</p>
               <p>Learne then that the word of GOD must alway be in our eye, well knowne and vnderstoode.</p>
               <p>That all our deuises, delights, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and practises must bee directed thereto.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:18"/>
               <p>And that the least swaruing frō thence, much more vvandring or rouing, is a sinne: so as that none can be too precise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crauing pardon</hi> followeth, which hath in it first a close confession of a more perticuler fault, viz. vncleanenes, for in that the Prophet desireth to be cleansed, he acknowledgeth specially that hee is vncleane: then a crauing of cleanenes.</p>
               <p>He seemeth in this manner of speech, to haue respect vnto the ceremonies of the law, where sundry creatures liuing, and without life, were counted vncleane, not so much in them selues, as in regard of vse to others.</p>
               <p>A sinner thē is vnclean, 1. such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be vsed to any good seruice, while he continueth so.</p>
               <p>First, in regarde that hee displeaseth God, whose commaundement he hath broken.</p>
               <p>Secondly, euen by the witnesse of his owne conscience as the Lepers. Leu. 13.45. so as that himselfe can doe nothing with quiet conscience; for as the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers &amp; other vncleane, were not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any thing except they would
<pb facs="tcp:14909:18"/>pollute and defile it, so it is with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by occasion of scandall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and so likewise making other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, all the godly, and some wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked can iudge.</p>
               <p>Note then that euery sinner, that is, whosoeuer willingly resteth in sinne, is vncleane, euen his very conscience. Tit. 1.15. so as that likewise all things to them become vncleane: neither can they goe about any thing with good conscience, while they abide in their sinnes.</p>
               <p>Shall not we then contemne vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Psal. 15.4. fearing to be soured by their leauen? or shall wee haue fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the vnfruitfull works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</p>
               <p>Or not our selues forbeare all sinne? seeing euery one doth make vncleane, and anger defileth our seruice to God. Math. 5.24.</p>
               <p>Let not any sinner looke to the shew he hath in the world, but to his cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes before God: euen for his scandalls towards men.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:19"/>
               <p>Thus much of the confession of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse: now followeth the desire to be clensed, which God commaundeth as necessary. Esay. 52.11. &amp; Ierem. 13.27. is likewise promised in Ezec. 36.21. hoped for by the Prophet. Psal. 19.13. So as that we should not beare euen the least spot, no not in others. Iud. 23. much more not in our selues, beeing all to be presented without spot, &amp; in the white shining robes of Christ.</p>
               <p>Now then, who seeth not himselfe to haue as much neede as Dauid, or anie, we euery one of vs drinking in sin. &amp;c. Wherefore, we ought as earnestly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it as euer he did.</p>
               <p>But first we must know what it is, viz. the purging of ones conscience from dead workes to serue the liuing God. Heb. 9.14.</p>
               <p>In which purging of conscience, is witnes of the pardon of fault, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting righteous, with ability and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes in all things to serue God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out both which, the conscience is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the sprinkling of Christes blood.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:19"/>Heb. 9.14. that is, the imputation of Christs sufferings on Gods part, and the applying of them specially vnto vs on our parts, as Ephe. 5.25.26. worketh this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, one is saide to be cleane by the word Iohn. 15.3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by faith. Acts. 15.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the spirit.</p>
               <p>So as that if we want any, wee want our cleanenes.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the thing generallie prayed for. Now followeth the partie to be considered, who is prayed vnto. And that is God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O God:</hi> that is, Father, Sonne, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost. Father from whom, Sonne, for whom, holy Ghost, by whō all good things doe come: Who onely can shew fauour, and forgiue sinnes: otherwise then the Papists teach, that Sacraments, Masses, Priestes, and Saints can doe.</p>
               <p>Nowe then a sinner seeking to God, looketh for in him, power, &amp; will.</p>
               <p>Power, is abilitie in God, whereby he can performe, whatsoeuer his chyldren should seek vnto him for: he is almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:20"/>all-sufficient, nothing hard vnto him.</p>
               <p>Will, is his liking and readines to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their good desires: &amp; that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Christes sake, so as that no Christ, no fauour.</p>
               <p>Now this will is shewen, 1. when hee commaundeth to pray for any thing. 2. when he promiseth to giue. 3. vvhen he giueth indeed.</p>
               <p>The Scripture sheweth thee, of these peticions euery where. It is cōfirmed to thee, 1. by the spirit working faith in thy hart, 2. stirring thee vp to seeke, 3. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thee continue in the vse of meanes.</p>
               <p>Marke then first, that in prayer wee direct our desires to the whole Trinitie, yet for order, most vsually to the Father, otherwise then the Papists charge vs with, to refuse to pray to Christ and the holy Ghost. Dooth not Stephen pray likewise to Christ, and that Dauid pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not vnto creatures, vvho neither know, nor can releeue our wants.</p>
               <p>That praying to God, we must doe it from the hart, which God searcheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and must haue the holy Ghost, and mediation of the Sonne; and that none
<pb facs="tcp:14909:20"/>can hinder vs from the benefit of prayer, beeing to God who is euery where, if wee doe it with great reuerence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>
               <p>Que. Is it sufficient onely to pray to GOD?</p>
               <p>An. No. But we must there-with vse the meanes, which we shall know to be appointed of God, to bring to passe the things we pray for.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the party to whom the prayer is made. Nowe followeth the measure in vvhich the thing is desired, which likewise is set out, as the thing prayed for, in foure branches.</p>
               <p>The first is, <hi>haue mercy,</hi> or be fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which cannot but as GOD is great, but be great. The word signifieth, of meere fauour to proceed with him.</p>
               <p>Nowe fauour, 1. respecteth no desert of the partie: 2. preuenteth: 3, is sildom wearie: this is in God.</p>
               <p>Thus would the Prophet be heart.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Not to be examined rigorously, for then he could looke for nothing.</item>
                  <item>2. Not to be put off alwayes.</item>
                  <item>3. Nor that god shold euer be weary.</item>
               </list>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:21"/>
               <p>The same minde is in euery one who prayeth aright: For if we should narow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee sifted, deferred, or afterward cast off, how should we doe?</p>
               <p>This is the first: The second is, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy louing kindnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Louing kindnes in Hebrew, <hi>Kesed,</hi> a naturall inclination or readines, to loue and fauour: this is in God.</p>
               <p>Wherby he is not only alwaies, 1, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to his: 2, but very sweet: 3, and also sure, into whom it is naturally ingrafted to be thus kinde.</p>
               <p>Who seeth not then, 1, that when one is throughly touched with feeling of sin, but that: In no case can hee beare to be put off, and not finde comfort present, so grieuous is the touch for sin.</p>
               <p>And yet God will haue them often waite.</p>
               <p>First, to shewe them, the things they pray for, come of fauour: 2, to make them earnestly to aske, and greatly, great things: 3, to exercise theyr fayth, hope, and practise of prayer: 4, to make them vse wel, the things they get with so great sute: 5, to make them the more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:14909:21"/>to God, and more to beware euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Feeling the betternes of sinne, they desire all sweete thinges to season theyr consciences.</p>
               <p>Indeede it is a good thing, truly and rightly thus to desire.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithstanding, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, God euery time graunteth it not: they must taste of gall &amp; wormwood.</p>
               <p>This is hard, but necessary, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, they feeling the sweetnes of fauor, desire it may be (as it is indeede) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p>Fearing, least they should againe leese it, which in no case they shall, if they cleaue to GOD as hee requireth in his word: 2, if euer they had fauour: 3, and desire continually to keepe it.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the second. The third is, <hi>According to the multitude of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi> Wherin is the thing, quantitie, the thing is compassions, or motherly pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, taken frō mothers or Dames to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theyr young ones: vvhich can hardly be tolde, but by Mothers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:22"/>
               <p>Now these are sundry &amp; very sweete. It is very hard to reckon vp the diuers kindnesses of Mothers to wayward chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but much more of God towards sinners.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One is, that some-time or other, he will make them see and feele theyr sinne and miserie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When they be throughly humbled, he will not fully nor finally forsake, thē.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He will watch ouer them, so as then ere euer they thinke of it, he will drawe them to conuersion: as in Paule, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, Luther, so as that euen theyr sins, shall turne to theyr good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hee neuer casteth them away for theyr sundry slipps, but receiueth them when soeuer they returne.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Now these are very tender, euen as of a mother.</item>
                  <item>2. They are seasonable.</item>
                  <item>3. Not alwaies to the will, but to the profit and good of the party.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The quantity followeth. The word vsed is <hi>Rab,</hi> and signifieth <hi>great, much,</hi> or <hi>manie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These mercies are great, 1. because
<pb facs="tcp:14909:22"/>they are from a great God, to such as we are, deseruing the contrarie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They last for euer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are in matters of very great worth, viz. saluation, as knowledge, faith, iustification, peace, ioy, patience, worth all the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are to take away sinne, which is great.</p>
               <p>Besides, they are many, 1. for number as before: 2. for that they are renewed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See then howe hainous some one sinne or other is, that to the pardon thereof, we haue neede of great &amp; much mercie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That hauing tasted the mercies of God, they who feele them are neuer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that vvhosoeuer once craueth mercy, must alwayes seeke to haue it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed as his sinnes renew, or else it is not sufficient.</p>
               <p>The fourth &amp; last, is much: so as that a man by himself, though he take snow, vvater, and much Nitor, shall not of him selfe be cleane. Christ therefore is like a purging fire, and like Fullers sope.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:23"/>Mal. 3.2. and Peter would haue his head and hands, beside his feete washed. Ioh. 13. whereof before in the word <hi>wash.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hetherto hath beene the chiefe sum of the whole psalme.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the more speciall set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of thinges necessary eyther for the Prophet himselfe, &amp; these from the beginning of the 3. verse, to the end of the 17. or for the church in generall in the two last.</p>
               <p>For the Prophet himselfe, in perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, &amp; those three. Confession of sinnes. Desires or requests. Thanksgiuing.</p>
               <p>Confession of sinnes from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 3. verse to the 7.</p>
               <p>This confession of sinne, is of <hi>Actuall,</hi> in the part of the 3. and 4. verses. And of <hi>Originall,</hi> in the 5. and 6.</p>
               <p>In the confession or acknowledging there is, First, the act of confession.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the parties. 1. Confessing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To whom the confession is made.</p>
               <p>The act setteth down the thing done. viz. 1. Confession. 2. The manner. 3. The helping cause, to wit, the being of his sinne before him.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:23"/>
               <p>Now this act or practise is brought in, as a reason to encourage the Prophet to perswade himselfe, that this his prayer is heard, because he doth not hide, but acknowledge his faultes according to that. 1. Iohn 1.9. And is brought in, as though the Prophet desired to preuent a doubt, which thus might be made.</p>
               <p>Why doe you pray so earnestly for fauour, and remission of sinnes?</p>
               <p>Aun. I knowe my sinnes better then any other doth, how many &amp; grecuous they are, I confesse them, this maketh me so earnest.</p>
               <p>Teaching vs heereby the greefe and trouble of a broken spirit, Pro. 18.14. and that the greater the feeling of sinne is, the more earnest will the desire of mercy be.</p>
               <p>But marke, that the Prophet confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and that first before he maketh any speciall sute.</p>
               <p>Confession of sinne is alwayes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, by Gods commaundement, that declareth that the party is touched, as vvhere there is smothering, one may doubt of feeling of sinne. It layeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb facs="tcp:14909:24"/>the sore that the plaister may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>The wicked alwayes conceale theyr faults, the godly are accusers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, neyther can they finde peace without it.</p>
               <p>The manner of this confession follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, set downe in the English worde <hi>know,</hi> not fully, for the most wicked and vnrepentant know their sinnes, and are neuer the better. Better were it therfore translated. <hi>I make knovvne to others,</hi> or acknowledge my sinnes. Well doe the Grammarians note, that in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew tongue, verbes of sence (as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is) doe signifie action also. Psal. 1. <hi>God knoweth the way of the righteous,</hi> that is, approueth or sheweth that hee knoweth. So Luk, 13.25. <hi>I knowe not,</hi> that is, I acknowledge not you, and so is it heere, I acknowledge, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Nowe this indeede is the property of Gods children, to make knowne theyr sinnes. Dan. 9. Paul &amp; Manasses.</p>
               <p>In this acknovvledging, there is 1. knowledge, that is, perceauing by the word of God, that the thing found fault
<pb facs="tcp:14909:24"/>with, is a sinne. All doe not presently yeeld heereto, as Saule, that this sinne doth deserue euerlasting damnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Application of the knowledge of the greeuousnes of sinnes to our owne selues, wherein especially consisteth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging: This is harder than the former. Better may one in generall know sinne, than him selfe in perticuler hath committed it. And yet this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, for this end are priuate messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to Dauid.</p>
               <p>Now this application or acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, must haue sundry properties.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It must proceede from the hatred of sinne: take heede of confessing sins, in iest or boasting: it is as in vomit, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting out thinges, enemies to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack.</item>
                  <item>2. With fayth in the promises of mercy in Christ, otherwise dispaire will assault.</item>
                  <item>3. From a setled iudgement, no light opinion, that our selues are sinners.</item>
                  <item>4. According to the things we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked of by the word: as it was vvith Dauid towads Nathan, not taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb facs="tcp:14909:25"/>against his charge.</item>
                  <item>5. Franke, not by compulsion, but of our owne accord.</item>
                  <item>6. Without excuse or lessening our fault, nay, rather with agrauating.</item>
                  <item>7. Without delay, that is, presently.</item>
                  <item>8. Without opinion of desert, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging sake.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Thus much of the manner, now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the helping cause, which is the being of his sinne euer before him. This made him the rather to confesse, because his sinne was alwayes before the eyes of his minde, and conscience, neither could he finde ease, till by confession he had set them aside.</p>
               <p>Of this cause we may see the kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes: and the property, euer.</p>
               <p>Sinne is before one, 1. When one who hath sinned, calleth his own sin to mind, and of purpose searcheth his heart to that end to humble him selfe. 2. When the conscience keepeth record against a mans wil, and so checketh him. 3. When God in mercy (the party not thinking of it) vseth some meanes, as Nathan to Dauid, Elias to Ahab: to make them
<pb facs="tcp:14909:25"/>for euer after to think thereof, all which I take it are meant heere.</p>
               <p>This euer, is with limitation from the committing of sinne, and taking true knowledge thereof, in his owne heart by meanes sent of God.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. So as that no meruaile if sometimes Gods children haue not their sinnes in their eyes, they must pray to haue eyes opened.</item>
                  <item>2. Let vs besides consider, howe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary this mercy of God is, to pricke our hearts to true conuersion, else shall we not see our sinnes.</item>
                  <item>3. The force of sinne once knowne, it will neuer leaue checking the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, till it be throughly taken away.</item>
                  <item>4. And that if we will be like the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, wee must often call our sinnes to minde, and exercise our selues there about: not seeke to forget them, or driue them out of our minde.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Hetherto is the manner.</p>
               <p>Nowe followeth the parties, the first confessing. I, Dauid a King, who had done this matter secretly, that few knew of it, whom no mans law could make

               <p>Now this person is God, not a Priest, to whom though in some cases we may confesse, 1. if wee haue scandalized or wronged him, 2. If wee endeuour to comfort him, by reckoning our faults and Gods mercies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or if we desire comfort from him, or desire him to pray for vs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not with conceit, that he hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to forgiue our sinnes, 2. or with iudging that wee ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of euery particuler.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither with opinion, that heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we deserue any thing, 4. Or are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:14909:26"/>to haue penance enioyned, to make satisfaction.</p>
               <p>To God confession is to be made. 1, For the commaundement sake: 2, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all sinnes are most against him: 3, Hee taketh knowledge of all sinnes: 4, He is able to forgiue them: 5, Hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth so to doe: 6, And hee hath so doone to Dauid, 2, Sam. 12. &amp; others.</p>
               <p>The party is God, who is set out part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Repetion. Partly by Singularitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repeticion,</hi> in these words; <hi>Against thee, thee onely.</hi> Which maner of speech, bewraieth, 1, an earnest affection of the hart, as not being able to cōtaine it selfe: 2, Great indignation against himselfe, so as that he seeth he hath broken the lawe of God, &amp; procured his displeasure: 3, &amp; yet perswasion of fauour: otherwise he durst not thus be acknowne.</p>
               <p>So as that all confession shoulde bee earnest, and in fayth: besides the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties had before.</p>
               <p>The singularitie of this partie follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in that it is said, <hi>against thee, thee on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</hi> VVhich all doe not expound alike. Some, against thee, who onely knowest
<pb facs="tcp:14909:27"/>what I haue doone, who onely canst pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Kinges. But rather I thinke against thee, whom it more troubleth me that I haue offended, then any thing besides: so as that, in comparison of the griefe I conceiue for displeasing of thee, I iudge this the onely thing: not but that Dauid did sinne against Bathsheba, Vriah, him selfe, and the people of God: but his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science was more troubled for sinning gainst God, then for all besides.</p>
               <p>VVee must not therefore in any case thinke, that the sinnes against men are nothing, or not to be confessed, or that those which are against men, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God.</p>
               <p>But onely, that the offending of God in any thing, most woundeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>And that as Dauid setteth out his sin in the grieuousnes of it, so should we, in that it is against God.</p>
               <p>Nowe no doubt, Dauid thought his sinne the greater, in that it was against God, who had beene so kind vnto him, so as that hee might be ashamed to be so vndutifull.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:27"/>
               <p>In that hee had made such good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in godlines, it could not but cut him, that now he should take the foile.</p>
               <p>In that being king, his example would be very scandalous to others.</p>
               <p>In that hee had so many helps to haue auoyded his sin, hauing choyse of wiues.</p>
               <p>In hauing tryed sundry meanes to cure his conscience, and nothing would pacifie it.</p>
               <p>Because the tentation seemeth not to haue beene fierce, but once, and not so strongly as many are.</p>
               <p>Thus in the like case are we to doe.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the sin confessed, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sin confessed, with originall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The fault: 2. Confession of woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of punishment.</p>
               <p>The fault is repeated, and is in two manners of speech. 1. In sinning. 2. In dooing euill in Gods sight; whereof the latter expoundeth the former.</p>
               <p>All this that the Prophet confesseth, is by occasion of one sin, indeede hauing a tayle of some more. What would hee haue doone if he had beene a common sinner?</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:28"/>
               <p>Marke then that one sinne, &amp; the selfe same, may often well be confessed. As Dan. 9. Psal. 25. Dauid calleth to mind the sinnes of his youth.</p>
               <p>The occasion heereof is this: 1, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Gods children haue a wondrous desire after saluation and forgiuenes, &amp; can neuer content themselues therefore. 2. Mans hart is vnsearchable, and neuer can throughly be sounded. 3. Fayth is weake. 4. Repentance vnperfect. 5. The deuill alwayes discouraging.</p>
               <p>So as that whosoeuer wil practise true confession, must often be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and paring away the same sinnes.</p>
               <p>What sinning is, may appeare before, so as heere we may spare to speake.</p>
               <p>The second maner of speech follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to set out the fault, <hi>Dooing euill in thine eyes,</hi> which fully setteth out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sinne, and is the dooing euill in the eyes of God.</p>
               <p>Heere are two parts, 1, matter of sin, 2. forme of sin.</p>
               <p>Matter is, dooing euill: euill is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. Of punishment. 2. Of faulte. So heere.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:28"/>
               <p>This is <hi>Anomia,</hi> and is well termed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, 1, because it displeaseth God: 2, hurteth the reasonable creature that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in it: 3, and indeed, infecteth the whole world.</p>
               <p>Now this euill heere, to make it more notorious, is set out with the article, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the particuler sinne, and grieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it. Ierem. 24.3.</p>
               <p>Let neuer therefore any thinke or speake of sinne, but with detestation &amp; mislike.</p>
               <p>Dooing, is any motion with consent, as to thinke, to will, to delight, and is so vsed, to teach the haynousnes of sinne, that consented to thoughts, and that sinne is very headlong: suddenlie from thoughts it will come to outward act: that none but should withstand euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corruptions, Atheisme, prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vnbeliefe, hypocrisie.</p>
               <p>Nowe followeth the forme: <hi>In thine eyes, ô God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD properly hath no eyes. But parts of the body are saide in Scriptures, to be in God for theyr workes sake: as because the eye is an instrument of
<pb facs="tcp:14909:29"/>knowledge, therfore it is put for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. So as that the Prophets meaning is, that God iudgeth this to be sinne, in whose eyes it is: God iudgeth that to be sinne, which is against his wil written &amp; reuealed.</p>
               <p>Learne then, that all men sinne, God looking on, sin is in his eyes.</p>
               <p>So as that 1, all sinners ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide whē they sin: 2. the godly ought to be very warie: 3, and to knowe, that as sinnes cōmitted are in his sight, so are good deedes.</p>
               <p>That the cōscience of his knowledge, 1, ought to support men in theyr good dealing, against all hard censures of the world: 2, And that God is very long suffering, who seeing so many sinnes, for all that spareth them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that Dauid cōsidering this, had wonderfull griefe, which wee well may examine by 2, Cor. 7.11. VVhere are sundry workes of this godly griefe set downe, the first whereof is, 1, Care, that is mature and conuenient dilligence to correct his fault, and to take away the scandall: to which is thwart and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:29"/>when a man not well vnderstanding his sin, can confesse, but deferreth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second, the Interpreters call Clearing, in the originall, is speech of defence for a mans selfe: vvhereby one may be iustly excused. Now this is, when a man confesseth his fault, craueth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes, applyeth Christes merrits, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth heed of the like sinne euer after, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then when in worldly matters, men deny or lessen theyr sinnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The thirde is indignation, viz. a practise of holy anger against our selues, whereby we often blame our selues, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any punishment. Heereupon, all that we doe, displeaseth our selues.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is feare, which is a stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the conscience, wherby we fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast all worst thinges vnto our selues: doubting least God should not giue vs repentance, and forgiuenes, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that mens and Gods anger, might breake out vpon vs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fift, is great desire, that is, a longing to satisfie: as Paule, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who might any way take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:14909:30"/>of theyr sin; with desire to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to theyr fauours and likings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The sixt is zeale, a most earnest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the soule, which cannot bee kept in, but breaketh through all, and will bewray it selfe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The last is reuenge, a voluntary practise of all duties, to keepe the bodie vnder, and preuent all like occasions for afterward. Thus much of repeating his fault.</p>
               <p>Nowe followeth his iudging of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, woorthy of any punishment. And that is, by reckoning vp wherein God might correct him in word or deed. For word, <hi>That thou mightest be iustified in thy sayings.</hi> For deede. <hi>And pure when thou iudgest.</hi> That is, though thou speake ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so sharply, or deale neuer so seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet all is iust, eyther in rebuking mee by Nathan, or taking away the childe by death, or whatsoeuer els.</p>
               <p>But the words and phrase must be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened first.</p>
               <p>Dauid did not sin to that intent, that he might make God to be or to appeare iust, but when he had sinned, then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb facs="tcp:14909:30"/>hee should doe or say to Dauid, were iust and deserued.</p>
               <p>But heere is a doubt, one would think that Paule, in the 3. to the Rom. ver. 4. dooth otherwise reade and apply this place, then seemeth to haue beene Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids meaning. Looke the place.</p>
               <p>Aun. Indeed he alleadgeth the place, according to the seauenty two interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which then, was most commonly vsed in the Church, which though it had sent differing sound in words from the Hebrew, yet the sence not much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, he thought good to vse.</p>
               <p>But for the application of it. Paul see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me to doe that, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ in a like cause doth. Math. 4, 10. Where our Sauiour seemeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the word onely, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of God, though it be not in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew: so that which the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid speaketh of God for his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Paul maketh a generall, that so it is in all parties, that God will be iustified and ouercome, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Others interprete it othervvise, as though the Prophet should vnderstand
<pb facs="tcp:14909:31"/>this word, <hi>I confesse,</hi> and then should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that thou mayest be iustified, that I must needes acknovvledge thou art iust. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But I take it, that the Prophet hath regard to, 2. Sam. 12. where God hauing threatned, and taken away the child, yet Dauid for all this, confesseth God to be iust.</p>
               <p>Well then in that, that Dauid, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus of himselfe, no doubt but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, hee ought to be patient, whatsoeuer should fall vpō him, so must euery child of God doe.</p>
               <p>But returne we backe, to consider of Dauids casting downe himselfe, &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the iustice of God, both in words and deedes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thou mightest bee iustified when thou speakest;</hi> but first open the words. <hi>Iustified,</hi> (not to reckon vp the sundry meanings of it, in diuers places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) doth here signifie, that thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to be counted, and iudged righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, speaking not falsly, neuer to sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or hardly.</p>
               <p>When thou speakest, or in thy speech,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:31"/>declaring no limitation of time &amp; place, whensoeuer thou speakest, that is, at all times.</p>
               <p>Speech, heere (I take it) is put for fault finding, or reproouing, as by Nathan. The meaning is, whatsoeuer thy words are, yet notwithstanding, euen by &amp; by in them thou be found, and iudged iust.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may appeare then by this, that as Dauid was sharply rebuked frō God by Nathan, so sundry times and other, the children of God, as Peter by Paule, &amp;c. And this must they looke for, if not personally by word, yet in the open mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, or in their priuate consciences: so are the Pharises called vipers, the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians foolish, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Dauid would shew, that his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did differ from the multitude, who think, that God is somtime too sharpe: for in deede so doe they, as Cain, and Iob in his impatience. Take heede then while we fret and charge God foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our hart, we be not of the humour of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that, that Dauid speaketh this by occasion of Nathan, he sheweth that
<pb facs="tcp:14909:32"/>Ministers speeches and rebukes taken out of Gods word, are from God him selfe, and therefore should be, 1. patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie heard, 2. taken to heart, 3. made vse of for life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That whatsoeuer the world or our flesh vvould mooue vs vnto, alwayes should we acknowledge God to be iust and vpright.</p>
               <p>Now followeth Dauids submitting to the iustice of Gods deedes. <hi>And pure when thou iudgest.</hi> As if he should say, whatsoeuer thou shouldest do vnto me, yet must I acknowledge thee iust &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, much more in that thou wilt not let the adulterous birth to liue: for God being infinite, might inflict infinite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but being good and iust, can doe nothing, but that which is most good and excellent.</p>
               <p>All this Dauid sayth, in this short speech, <hi>when thou iudgest, thou art pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein are two thinges ascribed to God, 1. Iudgement, 2. Purenes.</p>
               <p>Iudgement is taken two wayes, 1. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, for giuing sentence in a thing. 2. not properly, and then the part for the
<pb facs="tcp:14909:32"/>whole, is put for gouerning and ruling the world. So Christ saith. Iohn, 5, 22. <hi>The Father iudgeth no man, but hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all iudgement to the Sonne,</hi> that is, gouerneth not the worlde, or ordereth the world without the sonne, but by and with him: so it is, Psal. 98.9. and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times else-where in the scripture.</p>
               <p>Que. How is it saide heere, that God iudgeth, and Christ denieth, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudgeth?</p>
               <p>Aun. Dauid speaketh of God essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, Christ speaketh of the Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally, so as there is no oddes: for the whole Trinity iudgeth, and that God doth iudge the worlde, it is cleare. Gen. 18.25. Psal. 98, 9.</p>
               <p>And euen in particuler matters, as Sparrowes and haires, much more in mens crosses; so as that it shall be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse further to shew it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Knowe then, that nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by chaunce.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all thinges, howsoeuer they seeme to vs of GOD, are most wisely done. Though I take it, that iudging heere is yet somewhat more particulerly
<pb facs="tcp:14909:33"/>taken for correcting: as 1. Cor. 11.29. that which is translated damnation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is iudgement, that is correction: so, 1. Pet. 4.17. iudgement must begin, that is, correction must beginne, at the house of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. So as whatsoeuer meanes are vsed, know that God ordereth crosses. Thus thought Ioseph, Iob, &amp; Dauid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that there-vpon, wee ought alwayes to be patient, I held my peace because thou didst it. I will beare the wrath of the Lord, because I haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against him: yea, though it were to euerlasting damnation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In so much, that whatsoeuer means, yet God is to be sought to, for ease and fauour.</p>
               <p>This iudgement is heere with limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time. <hi>When,</hi> whereby is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vs, that God doth alwayes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereby he sheweth his long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, &amp; our weakenes for if he should, we were neuer able to abide it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in breathing time betweene crosses, we should labour for spirituall
<pb facs="tcp:14909:33"/>wisedom, strength, faith, &amp; patience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the next affliction.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the iudgement.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the purenes, <hi>Pure,</hi> it is a kinde of borrowed speech, for things not mixed, but sheere and like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, not as troubled mire, water, or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sea, but as wine without water, and siluer without drosse.</p>
               <p>The meaning is without any mixture of wrong doing, or vnrighteousnes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way keeping one tenor of vpright dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, accepting no person, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Who dareth doubt that God is thus? vvhen hee forbiddeth impurity to his creatures, whose inheritance with him is vndefiled, who cannot be seene, but by a pure hart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Well, then take heede of charging God with iniustice, euen in the matter of reprobation, much more in thine owne crosses.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And endeuour to be pure and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, like thy heauenly Father.</p>
               <p>Thus much of Dauids iudging him selfe, worthy of punishment: now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth next originall, in the 5. &amp; 6. v.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:34"/>
               <p>Touching this, the Prophet setteth it downe in two manner of speeches. <hi>I was borne in iniquitie:</hi> the second, <hi>And in sinne hath my Mother conceaued mee.</hi> Both which, are set out with the word <hi>behold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But first let vs endeuour, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the words, so shall we better know the sence.</p>
               <p>The word which is reade, <hi>borne,</hi> doth properly signifie, the time and greefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the deliuerie, and being brought in bed: so as that Dauids meaning is, as soone as hee approached the light, the darknes of sinne ouer-spread him.</p>
               <p>Iniquitie, here doth signifie in the full and largest meaning of it, to wit, guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that is, faultines, and deseruing pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and withall proofes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinne,</hi> is the transgression of the law, and the same with iniquitie.</p>
               <p>The other word, <hi>conceaued,</hi> properly cherished or heat, or warmed me, that is, in the wombe for the conception: and after, that is, as soone as euer the matter whereof I was made, was in the wombe, warme and enclosed, so soone and euen
<pb facs="tcp:14909:34"/>then began I to be tainted.</p>
               <p>Not that bed company betweene his father &amp; mother, and bed beneuolence (as some fondly haue thought) was sin: but euen from thence he was infected.</p>
               <p>For the cleanest hand that is, sowing pure vvheate, cannot cause, but when it springeth, it will haue straw and chaffe. &amp;c. Where-vpon it may seeme, that sin is drawne as well from the Mother as the Father: which the Papists seeme to denie. And whereas in the Rom. 5. it is ascribed to man, there I thinke the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is to be included.</p>
               <p>For the word <hi>behold,</hi> which is so vsual in the Scriptures, I take it not as manie learned men doe, to note a wonder, wheresoeuer it is set, but according to the plainenesse of the stile of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to set out a thing cōmonly known, or that which may be or shoulde bee knowne. Gene. 22, 7. <hi>Ecce me,</hi> almost 600. times in the Scriptures. As Luke, 7, 37. Iames 3, 3, 4. and so often else. Where in the same sence, as also heere, beeing in such a thing, as no seruaunt of God should or can be ignorant of.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:35"/>
               <p>The words thus opened, let vs come to the meaning of them altogether. The chiefe drift and intent is, to set out Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids first sin, which is heere noted to be, <hi>The iniquitie wherein he was borne, &amp; the sin wherein his Mother conceiued him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which two manners of speech, shew one and the selfe same thing: vvhich in another sound of words, is called by the Diuines about S. Augustines time and since, <hi>Originall sin.</hi> Which how-soeuer Dauid saith is in himselfe, is not onelie true in him, but in all man-kinde, Christ onely excepted, as shortly we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</p>
               <p>Wee may haue in this verse a full set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out vnto vs what it is. For vvhen Dauid saith <hi>me,</hi> hee meaneth his vvhole person, soule and body, and when hee mentioneth <hi>iniquitie and sin,</hi> he meaneth fault deseruing of punishment, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all corruption: and naming his mother &amp; conception, hee sheweth that it came from the first Mother to all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing chyldren.</p>
               <p>But first of the name, the learned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters giueth vnto it, which though in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables
<pb facs="tcp:14909:35"/>it be not in Scripture, is grounded there-vpon, as Gene. 6. &amp; 8.</p>
               <p>They call it originall, or of beginning, because it was from the beginning, as soone as euer the fault of Adam was.</p>
               <p>It is one of the first things that is in the chylde in the conception.</p>
               <p>It is the beginning of all sinnes, of deed and practise. And thus familiarly may be shewed vnto vs to be, <hi>A disorder of the whole man (touching matters of euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life,) or a decay of the Image of GOD brought vpon all mankinde, (Christ onelie excepted) by the fall of Adam and Eue: Whereby they are subiect to the anger of God, and inclinable to any sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Disorder,</hi> doth signifie a swaruing frō that it was or should haue beene at the first, &amp; a continuing so. Whereby is not onely the absence of goodnes and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes, but 2. also the presence of sin and euill: and 3. inhability in it selfe to reforme it selfe. These might be proued but for shortnes fake.</p>
               <p>In the mind was and should haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued full knowledge of God to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the comprehension of Artes
<pb facs="tcp:14909:36"/>and creatures.</p>
               <p>The will delighted in Gods will: the affections were stirred holily to their due obiects, in most due sort: The sences likewise, &amp; all other practises were ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: but now most is lost, the contrary come in, and wil hardly be dispossessed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The whole man,</hi> doth signifie soule and body, powers and parts. Gen. 6, 5, and 8, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first motions,</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The minde.</hi> Tit. 1, 15. And so of the rest.</p>
               <p>Yet must not we so meane, as though the substance were impayred, or the number of faculties; But as in a poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Fountaine, there is the running, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wholesomnes is taken away: So are the same, but the soundnes for theyr worke to fit them to proper thinges in due sort, is lost.</p>
               <p>All this while this must be remēbred, that wee vnderstand it of matters of the spirit, &amp; euerlasting life: for otherwise, natural men haue many excellent parts, for knowledge of the worldly creatures,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:36"/>artes, policie, &amp; such like. So 1, Cor. 2.14.</p>
               <p>This commeth by the disobedience of Adam and Eue, in whose loynes vvee were, who is our roote with whom wee stand or fall, of whose iuyce wee sauour and relish. For as in matters of treason, the Father tainteth all the blood, so is it in this case.</p>
               <p>The Parents propagate thys: neither is it as the Pellagians dreame, onely by imitation. Rom. 5.1. Tim, 2, 14.</p>
               <p>And it spreadeth ouer all man-kinde, (Christ excepted) the virgine Marie is not free.</p>
               <p>Besides, it subiecteth to the vvrath of God. Rom. 5. &amp; 7. euen in the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. It is not imputed indeed, but yet there it is, howe soeuer the Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine glosse, would corrupt the canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call text.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it inclineth to sin, Rom. 7. this neuer could the Heathen vnderstand.</p>
               <p>But heere questions are to be asked, and aunswered.</p>
               <p>What is the proper seate of this sin?</p>
               <p>An. The whole man, but especiallie, the minde and the will.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:37"/>
               <p>Against which cōmaundement is this sinne?</p>
               <p>Answ. Against all and euery of them.</p>
               <p>How commeth the soule to be infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with sin, since it is immediatly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, &amp; not begotten by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as the body is?</p>
               <p>Answ. Better it were to seeke to shake it off, since euery one must confesse, that he hath it, then curiously to search how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Euen as to cure a sore, and lift out of a pit, rather then to stande questioning how those dangers came.</p>
               <p>Some thinke, that this hunge vpon the appointment of GOD, who gaue all things to Adam, not for himselfe onely, but also for posteritie, not as a priuate man, but as the roote and head. Who standing, all other should continue with him, falling, bringeth all other downe: &amp; because the soule is part of the party, the body infected causeth the soule to be so accounted. But this is not sufficient.</p>
               <p>Others thinke that the soule is indeed created at the first pure, but yet weake, and assoone as euer it is ioyned to the
<pb facs="tcp:14909:37"/>body, receiueth tincture and infection. Both aunswers haue learned Authours, I like the last.</p>
               <p>Can this sinne be quite taken away in this life?</p>
               <p>Answ. No, so as it should not be, but is taken away so, as that in the elect and regenerate it is not imputed: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques (as the Fathers speake) are left to exercise vs with.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the opening of the words, nowe for the meaning see what we may further learne.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that Dauid, beeing checked for one sinne, thinketh of more, and euen the roote of all: he doth as others of the children of God doe and must doe: So seriously thinke of one sin, as that they finde out others: euen as when one v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a light to seeke some one thing, hee thereby seeth others. So thought Dauid of the sinnes of his youth. Psal. 25.7. and others. Gene. 42.21. &amp; v. 9. Wherfore that is no good confession, that findeth not out daily more and more sinnes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the worde <hi>behold,</hi> wee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that our originall sinne should
<pb facs="tcp:14909:38"/>be very well knowne, &amp; throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of vs, but it is quite otherwise, few or none perceiue it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The more seeing into the hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this sin, so we take heed of <hi>Flacius</hi> errours and others, is good profiting in grace, otherwise then the Papists are wont to lessen it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Seeing this sin is so naturall, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed, bred in the bone, we had neede to arme our selues cōtinually against it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Presume not too much of good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dispositions in matters of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, the best are infected with originall sinne, then which there is no worse poyson.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Parents must be careful, that as they naturally beget their children, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them with original corruption they procure theyr regeneration to wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filth thereof by endeuouring to make thē pertake the merrits of Christ, and also the power of his death, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the body of sin.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Neuer looke to be free in this life from it, neither be discouraged, if you take some foyles by it, wish to bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb facs="tcp:14909:38"/>vpon.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the setting downe of this sin; now followeth the laying open of it, and making it more cleere.</p>
               <p>Now the laying open of it is in the 6. verse, and is by cōparing with the quite contrary in the first creation, whereby the heynousnes of this will more cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare. For whereas GOD loueth truth in the inward affections, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth wisedome in the secret hart, is not Dauid out of square, that from the first is confectioned with sin? What a shame is it, that Gods will by my faulte should be violated?</p>
               <p>Now of opening, there is, 1. the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 2. the notoriousnes of it, as before.</p>
               <p>The matter is in two speeches. 1. <hi>Thou louest truth in the inwarde affections.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou teachest me wisedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But first come to the words.</p>
               <p>Truth in Scriptures signifie diuersly, more then neede to be spoken off heere.</p>
               <p>In this place I iudge it to be put for righteousnes, as that which in Gen. 24, 49. our English bookes haue truly: the 72. Interpreters, haue doing righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
<pb facs="tcp:14909:39"/>so is truth taken, Ephe. 4.21. for true obedience, which is called righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, ver. 24. so Isa. 26.2. the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nation is said to keepe truth, by way of interpretation, to vvhich purpose looke, Isa. 59, 14. but doing of truth, Iohn, 3, 21. is most bright: so is it (I take it) heere sincere obedience actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the law of God. It is called iustice, Eph. 4, 24. and is a part of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, by a metoninue of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct for the subiect.</p>
               <p>And is first heere named, because it is more manifest, though not more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie then wisedome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Louest,</hi> in the preterfect tense, and is alwayes true and present in God: yet I take it, we may fitliest interpret it in the preterpluperfect tense: hadst loued, that is, didst alwayes so loue, as that at the first, thou createdst man in it, &amp; art now angry with me, for hauing lost it: for I iudge the Prophet hath respect to the image of God at the creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inward affections,</hi> in Hebrew the reines, some say, the hart strings: a trope shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the seate of desire and affections,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:39"/>which they note, is in the kidnies, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Prophet meaneth the will &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>Wisedome is knowledge mentioned. Col. 3.10. In the secret of my hart. The Hebrew is onely in the secret, meaning in deede the hart, which is hid and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a filme, that it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, hee meaneth the minde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hast taught,</hi> I thinke for hadst taught, as before, respecting the creation.</p>
               <p>These are the wordes nowe, because one thing is meant in both these man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of speech, therefore not curiously speaking of them asunder, let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them both together, according to their intent.</p>
               <p>The Prophet laboureth to set forth his corrupted estate, with that which was at the first creation: the which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures call by the image of God, which Dauid no doubt heere poynteth out.</p>
               <p>Now to the image of, is the likenes to God, and was, 1. in Angels, 2. in men.</p>
               <p>We only must consider of it, as it was in man, and is heere set downe to be
<pb facs="tcp:14909:40"/>truth, in the inward affections, &amp; wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the secret hart.</p>
               <p>Where by the way, the errour of the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> thinking God like to mans body, is ouer-throwne, though Luther thinke they be falsely charged with this errour.</p>
               <p>Now in this description of the image of God, we may consider in what parts, and what things this likenes is.</p>
               <p>The parts are inward affections, and secret hart, that is, as we heard before, the disposition of the will, iudgement, and affections. In deede mans soule is a spirit somewhat like God, and had princedome ouer the creatures, as a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Gods soueraignty, but the seate of likenes, most principally is the soule.</p>
               <p>The things wherein the image is, first wisedome or knowledge, Col. 3, 10. which the deuill can tell, Gen. 3, 5. and heere is called wisedom, &amp; is a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of things to performance, of the will of God, for happy estate in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice.</p>
               <p>This had with it vnderstanding of the morrall law, all Arts, knowledge of all
<pb facs="tcp:14909:40"/>creatures, as in Adam, and somewhat in Salomon.</p>
               <p>And this was engraffed, that a man needed no maister.</p>
               <p>The second is iustice, Eph. 4.24. full obedience to the will of God, in desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, thinking, willing, nothing but gods will: this is heere called truth.</p>
               <p>Now these things were looseable, and in deede were lost, which we neuer here shall fully recouer.</p>
               <p>This is it which heere the Prophet so dolefully mourneth for.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Shall we nowe neede to be put in minde, that euery man ought to knowe these things, which few doe?</item>
                  <item>2. Or that alwayes thinking of this downefall, vvee shoulde continuallie mourne?</item>
                  <item>3. Besides, heere haue a glasse to trim our selues by, and a president where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ought all to fashion our selues.</item>
                  <item>4. And that in the practise heereof, we should begin at the reines, and heart, where the seate of these things are, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wee bridle the horse at the wrong end.</item>
               </list>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:41"/>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, heere is matter enough for all a mans life time, so as that he cannot be idle, but had neede be repayring till he proue like God.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the enlarging of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne, and for the confession, and so for the first particuler part of this psalme, in the Prophets owne behalfe.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the second particuler part, consisting of sundry sutes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires vnto God, from the beginning of the 7. v. to the middle of the 14.</p>
               <p>The first is, ver. 7. a most earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and hath two braunches, the first, for forgiuenes of sinnes, the second, for imputation of righteousnes, whereof both are conditionall, and presumed by faith.</p>
               <p>The first, <hi>purge mee with hysophe, I shall be cleane:</hi> which is, as if it were, if thou purge me (as I perswade my selfe thou wilt) I shall be cleane, wherein the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lednes of faith, as in all other petitions ensuingly made, is to be remembred, in vaine is it to pray, without some perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of being heard, when we haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement to pray, promise to bee
<pb facs="tcp:14909:41"/>heard, and experience that others haue beene heard, as before hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>Of the first, there be two members, whereof the one is cause, the other, the effect: the cause purging with <hi>Isope,</hi> whereof the one seemeth to be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, the other helping.</p>
               <p>The principall, is purging, the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and forme whereof, is to be considered.</p>
               <p>The signification sheweth, that hee desireth to be made cleane from fault: (for who is free?) but that it should not be imputed. Which though it be neuer in any party seuered from imputation, yet for teaching sake, it so may be.</p>
               <p>The forme of the verbe, is the future tense, for the Imparatiue moode most vsually in scriptures, which declareth a full assurance and perswasion of faith.</p>
               <p>The helping is Hisope, some transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it Mosse, one thinketh it may bee Rosemary, whereof their legall sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, might be made: but the Author to the Hebrewes, taketh away all doubt,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:42"/>in the 9. chap. hauing the word <hi>Hysope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better vnderstanding wherof, it will not be amisse, to haue recourse to the ceremoniall law, where, Leuit. 14.7. it is vsed, in purging of the leaprosie, and Numb. 19, 9. for lesser vncleanenesses, both which, no doubt Dauid thought of when he penned this. Iudging of his sinne as of leprosie, not neglecting the desire to be purged, euen from the least. Mention likevvise is made of Hysope, Exod. 12, 22. but the other meaning ought to like vs, for the 9. to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.</p>
               <p>But some man may say. Why is there so often mention of Hysope made?</p>
               <p>Aun. Not for that it hath any force of it selfe to cleanse the soule, but hauing some naturall property to open and cleanse the body, vvas appoynted of God, as it were a sacramentall signe, and doth very fitly represent the blood of Christ, who cleanseth vs from all sinne, 1. Iohn, 1.9. so doe the bread and wine in the supper, water in baptisine, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Christ.</p>
               <p>Nowe then this Hysope is not for it
<pb facs="tcp:14909:42"/>selfe, but to represent the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, 1, Pet, 1.2. Heb. 9. that is, the death and sufferings of Christ applyed.</p>
               <p>So as that the Prophet desireth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of sprinkling, with the fruite thereof.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. First therfore it is manifest, that he vnderstoode the ceremonies or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as euery Christian should.</item>
                  <item>2. He knew that they all did tende to Christ.</item>
                  <item>3. And rather desired the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then rested in any outward act.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Papists abuse this place for theyr holy water: 1, whereas all such legall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are deade euerlastingly: 2. neither haue they any newe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from God: 3. nor can they euer shewe, that the sprinckling for the acte done onely, (as in theyr holy water they imagine) did good to the soule.</p>
               <p>Now in that the Prophet nameth this first, he teacheth that our care should be first and greatest for pardon of sinnes: then all other things follow.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the cause.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:43"/>
               <p>Now followeth the effect, <hi>And I shal be cleane.</hi> Metaphor, that is, I shalbe free from fault.</p>
               <p>Whereby he sheweth, 1, that by Christ hee shall be fully clensed, so as that hee shal need no other meanes to take away any remainder by occasion of sinne: no, there shall be no reliques to be satisfied for in Purgatory. 2. That this solely by Christ, for he speaketh it without doubt, that he shall be cleane: that is, by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>This is the first branch, the second followeth. <hi>Wash me, and I shall be whiter then snow.</hi> this is, for imputation of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.</p>
               <p>Heereof there are two parcells as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: The first is the cause: the second, the effect.</p>
               <p>The cause, is in the word <hi>wash,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he eyther hath respect to the Priestes washings of themselues, or the leaprous persons: but of this enough before.</p>
               <p>Which besides purging is mentioned, because that Christ came as well by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as blood. Iohn. 1, 15. Water signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full holines.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:43"/>
               <p>The effect, <hi>I shall be whither then snow.</hi> A hyperbolicall metaphor, meaning, he shall be most perfectly, cleane.</p>
               <p>Nowe by both these sentences, one thing is principally meant, as is often seene in the Scriptures. In both which, ioyntly we may consider, 1, the necessitie of this iustice, 2, the desire of it, 3, the commendation of it.</p>
               <p>The necessitie of it appeareth, in that the Prophet maketh it his first suite, wherein alone is euerlasting happinesse. Psalm, 32. Rom. 4. So as that indeede without this, there can be no fauour loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for at Gods hand. It is the wedding garment, and the one thing necessary: without the which, like Iacob in Esaues clothes, we neuer shall obtaine the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
               <p>The desire of it followeth: <hi>Purge me with: wash mee.</hi> Wherein are 1, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son purging and washing: 2, the thing where with this purging is, Hysope: 3. the partie receiuing: <hi>I Dauid, purge me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God, euen the vvhole Trinitie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, the Father for the Sonne, and by the holy Ghost.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:44"/>
               <p>And that onely. I, euen I, for mine owne sake, put away thy sinnes. Esay, 43.25.</p>
               <p>God thus dooing this, is said in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to impute, that is, to account or reckon: and is a borowed kind of word taken from debts, or reckonings, as whē I owe a great sum and my suretie paieth it for me, by creditour cancelling or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering my band, doth impute that pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto mee. This is not a putatiue righteousnes, as the papists falsely charge it to bee, where they set themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God while theyr Priests take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the power and act of forgiuing sinnes.</p>
               <p>The second is the thing where with this purging and washing is, and that is here by hysope &amp; water, signifying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, the full righteousnesse of Christ: which is his obedience vnto the death for vs.</p>
               <p>Christ is God and man, his manhood suffering, his god-heade giuing merrite thereto.</p>
               <p>The obedience is actiue or passiue: His actiue is the fulfilling of the morrall
<pb facs="tcp:14909:44"/>lawe, in the rigour of it.</p>
               <p>His passiue righteousnes, are his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, from the beginning of his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to his resurrection, which were verie many, very grieuous, and with the feeling of the anger of God, and becō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a curse.</p>
               <p>Both these are counted to vs, to the, pardon of all sinnes fault, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the counting of all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and fauours with that.</p>
               <p>Now that which is said of Christ, is to be vnderstoode of him alone, without mixture of any other thing whatsoeuer, nothing besides beeing able to make so white as Christes righteousnes.</p>
               <p>The third thing, is the partie recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, &amp; that is Dauid, &amp; heere as there, is imputation on Gods part, there must be application in the partie praying, viz. fayth. For as the sprinckling of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sope and water was receiued, so must Christ be: heere therefore fayth is most necessary to be knowne: 1, the obiect: 2, the parts: 3, the properties of it.</p>
               <p>The generall obiect of fayth, is the whole word of God, but more particuly
<pb facs="tcp:14909:45"/>the doctrine of saluation by Christ, as the marrow and pith of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The parts of fayth are three: The first knowledge, which is a perceiuing of the meaning of the word of God, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of saluation by Christ, which then we may iudge to be sound, when we can discerne falshood: when we rest vppon grounds of Scripture: vvhen nothing can driue vs from it.</p>
               <p>The second, assent, with a ful perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that the former is true.</p>
               <p>The third, affiance or application: whereby wee are perswaded, that the word of saluation is ours: and heere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede lyeth the chiefe force of Fayth; whereas the wicked may haue the other parts.</p>
               <p>The properties follow: commonly it is small and weake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It desireth to increase.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It maketh the hart to thinke most highly of Christ.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It will change the whole man.</p>
               <p>The cōmendation of this iustice fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. <hi>I shall be whiter then snow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Que. How can this be, seeing euerie
<pb facs="tcp:14909:45"/>where the Saints in Scriptures, doe disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theyr owne righteousnes, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of it?</p>
               <p>Ans. Righteousnes is two fold, I, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification: 2, sanctification.</p>
               <p>That which the Saints mislike, is the imperfectnes of theyr sanctification, not of iustification, which can haue no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish: indeed sanctification is neuer seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from a party iustified, yet it must be distinguished from iustification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gather then frō hence, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes righteousnesse imputed vnto vs, is most perfect: &amp; that God cannot in the rigour of his iustice, find fault with it, els could not the Prophet by it be so white.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When wee consider of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to abide by the iudgement of God all ours, if neuer so inwarde sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That perfectnes may stande with vnperfectnes, that is, perfectnes of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, with imperfectnes of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That all iustified parties, are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied equally, euery one pertaking the righteousnesse of Christ: as Marie and
<pb facs="tcp:14909:46"/>Rahab, Peter and the thiefe. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not from hence, that glory should be equall.</p>
               <p>Thus much of this perticuler peticion, the second followeth in the eyght verse. <hi>Make me to heare. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This particuler desire, is for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation of the former: and is a fruite of that wherin we may consider to things: 1. That which is praied for. 2. The end.</p>
               <p>That which is prayed for, is <hi>Make me, &amp;c.</hi> The end, <hi>That the bones which thou hast. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that which is prayed for, wee may consider what is desired from God to be bestowed, then what of the Prophet to be receiued.</p>
               <p>That which God is desired to giue, is to make to heare. That which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would require, is ioy &amp; gladnes.</p>
               <p>The maner of words, <hi>Thou shalt make mee heare,</hi> it is in sted of make mee to heare, by a very vsuall manner of speech in the Hebrew tongue.</p>
               <p>Nowe surely, very fitly is this desire ioyned to the former, as in the 32. psal.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:46"/>after the doctrine of forgiuenes of sinns, reioycing. ver. 11. so Rom. 5, 3.1, Iohn, 1, 4. so as that without the former, this can neuer be, and where the other is, this is.</p>
               <p>Howsoeuer the wordes heere stand, the first in nature, which the Prophet prayeth for, is ioy and gladnes.</p>
               <p>Ioy and gladnes, though they much agree in one, yet is the latter some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the former.</p>
               <p>Ioy, is a sweete motion in the soule, vpon opinion, of hauing some present good, which according to the cause and obiect, is diuers: for when nature is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, with any thing pleasing or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing it, then is naturall or fleshly ioy; so when the regenerate part is delighted with some grace or heauenly thing, this is holy or spirituall ioy, which is chiefely meant in this place: sometimes indeede God giueth comfort of this world, but it is not generall, nor simply to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. This is a fruite of faith: and is, Peace of conscience encreased, arising vpon the sweete feeling of Gods loue in Christ, whereby wee can be cheerefull
<pb facs="tcp:14909:47"/>in afflictions.</p>
               <p>And that it is peace of conscience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, it is cleare, bare peace is quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ioy must needes be more, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore followeth vpon peace. Gal. 5, 22.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is with such a feeling of the fauour of God, as that it is part euen of the Kingdome of God, Rom. 14, 17. and therefore by Peter, is called glorious ioy. 1, Pet . 1.</p>
               <p>How it maketh to reioyce in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Paul sheweth, Rom. 5, 3.</p>
               <p>Nowe no doubt Dauid prayeth for this, as it should be in the children of God: for Paul, 1, Thes. 5, 16. requireth them to reioyce euermore: and in the Phi. 4.4. reioyce in the Lord, &amp; againe I say, reioyce.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus in some sort, seene the meaning of this first, wee cannot but learne somwhat by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first, that howsoeuer all ioy haue some sweetnes, yet the Prophet desireth none that is of the worlde, so ought we to doe, and if God sent it, to endeuour to vse it a right, which is very hard.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:47"/>
               <p n="2">2. Againe, in that he is thus earnest for this ioy, it appeareth, that either he had it not at all now, (as was most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he, by reason of his greeuous sinne,) or not in such measure, as he longed for it. And sure it is, that nothing quayleth and alayeth this ioy, more then sinne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A man may be in the fauour of God, and alwayes not feele ioy in the holy Ghost. Indeede it is an excellent gift, but such as many times Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vvant, though neuer they vvant matter to make them reioyce.</p>
               <p>This is the first branch prayed for, the second is gladnes, this is encreased ioy. Hee feeling intollerable greefe for sinne, can neuer be satisfied, but wisheth all comfort to his broken heart: so did he, Psal 32, 11. and Phil. 4, 4.</p>
               <p>Nowe in deede well might the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet be stirred thus vp to pray: for the sundry great causes of greefe, which hee might finde in himselfe: as other the children of God, who sometimes mat be brought so low, as to thinke that all Gods comforts are too little for them.</p>
               <p>So as that men must not giue ouer,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:48"/>though sometimes they be brought so low.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is a good signe, to finde the want, &amp; long for the hauing of this ioy, and the more the better.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the things, which on Gods part he prayeth for: <hi>Make me to heare,</hi> wherein is, 1. the Author, 2. the meanes.</p>
               <p>The Author is God, who onely can giue this ioy, Iohn. 16.22. so as that it can neuer by any be taken away, to whō we must onely seeke.</p>
               <p>The meanes is hearing, for this ioy beeing a fruite of faith, is bread, by the worde of fayth: which specially is the Gospell, so as all must attend thereto.</p>
               <p>In that hee desireth to be made heare this ioy, whereas ioy indeede is rather in feeling, he sheweth that we must hang vpon the word, wayting against heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, to be full possessed of this ioy, here we heare of it: after we enter into it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Enter into the ioy of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much of the thing. Now follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the end.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:48"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the bones, &amp;c.</hi> It is allegoricall, that is, one thing is said, and an other is meant.</p>
               <p>The Prophets mind is, to finde some sweete comfort after great greefe: the better to set out this greefe, hee vseth a comparison of broken bones, which are meruailously painfull to any, in whom they are. And he seemeth to fetch this speech from the practise of Lyons, who first breake the bones, and then deuour: so saith Ezechiah, in his great greefe, Isa. 38, 13. he brake all my bones like a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for so in Dan. 6, 24. are Lyons, said to haue broke the bones of Daniels e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or euer they cam to the ground. And therefore it is obserued, in the first booke of kings. 13, 27. that when the old Prophet came and found the body of the younger Prophet dead, that the Lyon had not eaten the carcasse, nor broken (for so the Hebrewes) that is, the bones of the Asse.</p>
               <p>So as in the midst of this greefe of Dauid, hee seemeth to himselfe to see God, as a fierce Lyon to come vpon him, and put him in great paine, &amp; more
<pb facs="tcp:14909:49"/>feare. All this is in the conscience, so as that vnlesse one haue felt the wound of spirit, he could hardly gesse that it shold haue such terrours.</p>
               <p>See in Dauid, that the greatest greefes that are, doe not shew a desperate estate. God can euen bring to the gates of hell, and yet raise vp againe, as he did him.</p>
               <p>And yet that it is a good thing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatnes of sinne, greatly to sorrow: Our Sauiour liked it in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that vvashed his feete vvith her teares.</p>
               <p>But alwayes in the midst of terrours, we must take heede wee be not driuen from God. And onely peere vpon our greefes: for Dauid nowe could pray, that these his bones might reioyce, that is, that he might feele as much comfort as he had felt sorrow: shewing, that as God can, so many times hee doth send meruailous ioy after greefe.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the second petition, a third followeth. ver. 9. <hi>Hide thy face, &amp;c.</hi> vvhich is in part a repetition, of that which was generally prayed for, in the first verse of the Psalm: and is in it selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:49"/>a desire to haue pardon of sinne.</p>
               <p>It consisteth of two branches, bearing the same fruite, and signifying the same thing: the first branch is, <hi>Hide thy face from my sinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which words are not in their proper meaning.</p>
               <p>Face, is put for the eyes, and eyes for sight and knowledge: from hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth bewraying of mislike, for when we see a thing that displeaseth vs, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray our mislike by our countenaunce, and therefore Dauid would haue God not to looke vppon his sinne, least hee should, as he justly might, mislike him.</p>
               <p>Hiding is, that Dauids sinns came not into Gods sight.</p>
               <p>Que. But heere may be a question, howe can any thing couer Gods eyes, who is all eye, and euery where?</p>
               <p>Aun. These things are not properly spoken, but to our capacitie, whereby Dauids desire, that God should not take knowledge of his sinnes, as hee should punish them, is set downe. Indeede no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can couer Gods eyes against his will, yet himselfe may shut his eyes, or
<pb facs="tcp:14909:50"/>wincke, as Acts, 17, 30. &amp; though he can not chuse but know our sins, yet he may choose whether he will mislike vs (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Christ) or punish vs for them, which is the thing that Dauid desireth.</p>
               <p>Nowe the onely veile that couereth Gods eyes, from beholding our sinnes, is Christ, and his righteousnes, which God the Father beholding doth so like, and take such pleasures in, as that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth not our vnworthines, nay loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king through Christ, doth account vs worthy.</p>
               <p>The other branch foloweth. <hi>Put away all min iniquities,</hi> vvhich because it was in the beginning of the Psalme, needeth not heere to be treated of.</p>
               <p>Now followeth a fourth desire in the 10. verse. <hi>Create in me a cleane heart. &amp;c.</hi> And this is for sanctification, as also hath two parts in it, whereof the one dooth serue to expound the other.</p>
               <p>The former is, <hi>Create in me a cleane hart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hart,</hi> is not put for the fleshly part of the body, but for the soule, and not for the substance and powers, but qualities
<pb facs="tcp:14909:50"/>thereof, vvhich keepeth espcially resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there. And though it be all ouer the body, yet hath it the chayre of estate in the hart, according to the Scriptures: otherwise then some Philosophers and Phisitions write, that it is in the braine.</p>
               <p>So as that the Prophet here meaneth, the very fountaine and head-spring of life, and all functions thereof.</p>
               <p>This is the more to be marked, for the order; in that hee desireth to haue the hart wrought vppon.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because that without the hart, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be cleane in man.</item>
                  <item>2. With the hart, alwayes the rest of the body and soule followeth.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It is therefore all our duties to labour to haue our harts wrought vppon first. For as the hart in the body, &amp; the roote in the tree first are made: so must it bee in grace, the hart and the soule must be setled first.</p>
               <p>Afterward, hee prayeth to haue thys cleane: that is, free, not onely from the guilt of sinne, but from the filth &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of it, which is specially meant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creating,</hi> to speak properly, is to make
<pb facs="tcp:14909:51"/>of nought, and is vsed heere vnproperly, the Prophet speaketh according to his owne feeling, and present iudgement of himselfe, as though he had lost all, &amp; had no goodnes in himselfe. No doubt the prophets hart was in part cleane, though not so much as he desired.</p>
               <p>These things thus opened, here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a question first to be aunswered.</p>
               <p>Qu. Whether Dauid could haue lost the cleanenesse of hart, hauing once had it?</p>
               <p>An. No, the gifts &amp; calling of God, that is, (as I take it) the gifts of effectual calling, are such, as God neuer repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of, or taketh away. Fayth, hope, &amp; charitie, are abiding gifts, as sure as the election of God, which is vnchangeable. Indeed, the children of God, if we only considered thē in themselues, with their enemies, might fall away, but beeing founded vpon the vnchangeable nature of God, and immutabilitie of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, they cannot: the gates of hell shall not preuaile against them: the elect can not bee deceaued, or plucked out of Christes hands. Nay certaine it is, that
<pb facs="tcp:14909:51"/>Dauid did not actually leese his former cleanes, for sure it is, his hart smiting him, (as heere it did) so dooing before in lesse matters, it was not wholely voyde of cleanes: and againe, it could not pray for cleanes, if it were not some-what cleane.</p>
               <p>This is most sure, that by grieuous sins, much filthines commeth to the soule, as by a boysterous winde a tree may leese his leaues, and some branches, so as that the partie sinning, may be brought into as great passions almost, as if he had lost all: but the desire of grace, is vnfallible certaintie of some grace of that kind.</p>
               <p>The Prophet therefore desireth not a cleane hart because hee had it not in no sort: but because he could not so vvell perceiue it in himselfe, and take such cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it as he had done before: and for that he desired it a great deale more, then now he had it.</p>
               <p>So learned men, and rich men, thinke themselues not learned, nor rich, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that which they doe desire: and when the Sunne is vp, the Moone see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue no light.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:52"/>
               <p>VVell then, in that the Prophet desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this cleane hart, whereas sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts were vncleane besides, hee sheweth, that, 1, Of all vncleannes, that which is of the hart is most filthy, there being as it were the common sinck of all sinne in a man, so as that howsoeuer the channels be clensed, if the draine be not, little cleannesse will be procured.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that his filthinesse maketh him pray for fresh cleannes, as though hee had not any, see to what a passe some grosse sin may bring a man vnto, euen to doubt of his estate touching his clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and so being in the fauour of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No doubt it is a very hard thing to clense a hart, and onely able to be doone by God himselfe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is none but with Dauid, may finde filthinesse in his hart, from whence hee might desire to haue it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For this purpose read, Mark. 7.21, 22. and 2. Cor. 7.2.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now Dauid so prayeth for a cleane hart, as that hee dooth not neglect pure hands, &amp;c. A pure hart, will clense the whole body and soule, wheresoeuer it is.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:52"/>As Psalme, 24.4.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Neuer can any of the chyldren of God, content themselues with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun cleannes which they haue, but they will alwaies be growing in it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now seeing it is thus, it is our parts to desire cleannes as well as Dauid: for that with it, wee may see God. Math, 5.8. Looke Psalm, 24.4. Heb. 6.12.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Nowe God onely worketh this. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech. 36.26. By this worde fayth &amp; spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, regenerating and renuing.</p>
               <p>Que. But heere a question may be made. Howe may one know, whether his hart be cleane, yea or no?</p>
               <p>Aun. If hee haue the former thinges whereby it is wrought.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Besides, a cleane hart will desire to haue cleane hands, and so euery part, &amp; power of soule and body.</item>
                  <item>2. Will hate euen the garment spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the flesh.</item>
                  <item>3. Will neuer flatter it selfe in secret.</item>
                  <item>4. Will be willing to be examined: vncleane persons will be loath to be foūd in their filth.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Thus much of the former part, the
<pb facs="tcp:14909:53"/>latter followeth, and is almost the same with the former. First somewhat for the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spirit,</hi> among many things in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which it signifieth, is heere put for the motion &amp; stirring of the mind. Luk. 9.55. Num. 14, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Right,</hi> doth signifie setling, 1, in the fauour of God: 2. in the obedience of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Renue,</hi> that is, refresh: that which is some-what decayed and blemished , re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it to the former perfection againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Within me,</hi> that is, such as may spred ouer my whole person.</p>
               <p>Consider then, that seeing Dauid prayeth for his right Spirit, which is cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, that there is such an one: and that one may haue it, and pray for it by faith.</p>
               <p>That all are to labour to be constant, in perswasion of Gods loue to vs, and in performance of our duties to him.</p>
               <p>That euen first thoughts, and rising motions, are to be looked vnto and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. That these good motions wil fade &amp; decay in vs. That we greatly need to haue them often renued in vs.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:53"/>
               <p>Thus much of the fourth peticion, nowe followeth the fift, in the 11. verse, and seemeth to be a deprecation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, to haue some kinde of punishment from him.</p>
               <p>Some take it to be all one with that, which went before. Neuerthelesse, I take it, to be distinguished from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for although some-times in one verse, the latter is all one with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet is it not wont so to be in diuers verses, and especially in such short scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but vpon some speciall occasion.</p>
               <p>This desire then containeth request, to haue perticuler iudgements or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments kept from the Prophet. For to the fault of sinne, belongeth diuers roddes and scourges, which the prophet heere feareth.</p>
               <p>Now this desire hath two parts: The first, <hi>Cast me not away from thy presence.</hi> The other, <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi> In both which, the Prophet Dauid seemeth to haue respect to Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Saule, whom he cast off from being King, as to haue the kingdome continued in his line, and from whom
<pb facs="tcp:14909:54"/>likewise, he tooke his good Spirit.</p>
               <p>The presence or face of God in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, signifieth sundry thinges, which were too long to recite. Heere it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth three thinges: 1, the fauour of GOD: 2, the place of the worship of God, where the face and fauour may be perceiued: So Gene. 4.10.14. Iob. 1.3. 1. Sam. 26.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Seruice before or in the presence of God: within Dauid was his seruice, in gouerning the kingdome. So Math, 18, 10. Iob, 1.6. These the Prophet desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to leese.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cast me not:</hi> take not these away from me in anger, otherwise, I shall endeuour to beare the losse patiently.</p>
               <p>First nowe let vs learne by Dauid, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde Gods dealing towardes Saule, to profit, and to be the wiser, for Gods iudgements in others.</p>
               <p>Let vs a little inquire, whether this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour that the Prophet feareth to leese, be for and to saluation: or in things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to this life. For the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof, some sentences must first be set downe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:54"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Dauid had the fauour of God to saluation.</item>
                  <item>2. Dauid could neuer fully, and for euer, leese it.</item>
                  <item>3. Dauid might haue the feeling of it, so impaired, as that hee might feare that he should loose it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, this fauour is not heere meant: but that fauour, whereby God first gaue Dauid the Kingdome, aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to the honour of being Gods Lieuetenant, to gouerne his people, in hauing God for his defence and grace, as Saul had for a time: which fauour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong outward things, is the greatest in the world.</p>
               <p>This Dauid desireth, may not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him: 1, not so much for the Kingdomes sake, as that God might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray to others, that hee was displeased with Dauid.</p>
               <p n="2">2, That Dauid might not by occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons heereof, cause the aduersaries to blaspheme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That yet Dauid might haue his high place, frō whence he might make open confession, and acknowledging of
<pb facs="tcp:14909:55"/>his fault to all his kingdome.</p>
               <p>Thus much for that question.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Now all that are aboue others, if they meane to keep their wealth, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, in the fauour of God, they must take heede of sinne.</item>
                  <item>2. Since that Kingdomes are taken from Princes, and so meruailous chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings and troubles come, we had neede to pray for Kings, that they sinne not, &amp; if they sinne, that they may repent.</item>
                  <item>3. That euen for sinnes, God taketh away outward fauours.</item>
                  <item>4. That in lesser matters, as any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, it greeueth the seruaunt of God, to see any displeasure of God.</item>
               </list>
               <trailer>Hetherto the first part, the second fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</trailer>

            <div n="2" type="part">
               <q>Take not thy holy spirit from me.</q>
               <p>Spirit, doth heere signifie, the gift of the spirit, as else-where in scriptures.</p>
               <p>As Saule therefore lost such gifts, so Dauid prayeth, he may not, to wit, loue of his Country, and people, prudence, courage, making good lawes, felicity, or good successe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He teacheth vs then, that sinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
<pb facs="tcp:14909:55"/>not onely the impairing of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing graces, but the losse euen of gifts, meete for a mans particuler vocation: so God threatneth. Mal. 2.2. to curse their blessings, and saith, Ezech. 20.26. that he polluted them in their gifts: so Nabuchadnezer is said, to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a beast. Dan. 4. that is, to loose the vse of reason, after the same manner, Naball became a sot, or a stone. 1, Sam. 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That euen the gifts of a mans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are from the spirit of God: so as that the meanest calling, or gift belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, is not to be despised.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That euery one is to endeuour to haue, to preserue and encrease the gifts of his calling.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now as all gifts are good, so those which are for the ordering of familie, Citty, or Kingdome, are most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Mention of the holy spirit, is made, to teach vs, that all duties are to be done holily.</p>
               <p>They are done holily, when, 1. the kinde of life is warrantable by the word of God; that is, when it any way setteth
<pb facs="tcp:14909:56"/>out the glory of god, or procureth good to others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The party performing any duty, is in Christ, and repenteth for sinnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He doth the duties for conscience to God, and as in the presence of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the vnderstanding of duties, he calleth vpon God.</p>
               <p>Hetherto the fift petition, the sixt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. v. 11. <hi>Restore to me thy ioy of thy saluation, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein he desireth to haue the gifts of the spirit giuen him againe, which he had lost, by reason of his sinne, for sinne doth mightily daunt, and dull the graces of the spirit.</p>
               <p>Of this petition, there are two parts. 1. to haue the ioy of Gods saluation, the other, to be established with Gods free spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Restore,</hi> doth properly signifie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, that which is not a mans owne, to the proper owner: but so can it not be taken heere;, for all things are properly Gods, nothing our owne heere. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dauid desireth to haue those things giuen him againe, which he had before,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:56"/>and hath now lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioy,</hi> doth signifie cheerefulnes of the hart, as v. 8. and with it alwayes seeking vpon conceit of want, hoping to haue in seeking, resting in hauing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saluation.</hi> doth not heere signifie, the estate of blessed life, but outward safety, when as the Prophet can, wanting any thing, come cheerefully to God, seeke to him, be perswaded of his helpe, &amp; finde it: so is it. Exod. 14.13. Psal. 33. and that we may so vnderstand it, heere may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: 1. because that euerlasting salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can neuer be lost, God for sinnes taketh away outward safety and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God dooth threaten some such thing to Dauid by Nathan, 2, Sam. 12.10.11.</p>
               <p>Now this outward saluation or safety spoken of, hath with it, 1. Gods promise to helpe, 2. and certaine performance thereof.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Note then that sinners not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, haue no security, euen of outward estate, nor can haue any heart to seeke vnto God: it is otherwise with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

                  <item>4. Dauid ascribeth all outward safety to God, what meanes so euer he had, so must we.</item>
                  <item>5. Dauid felt Gods sauing of him. Men must not vse the benefits, without some feeling of them, that they may the more be thankfull for them.</item>

               <p>God vpholdeth all things by his word and power, and so doth he euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, euen the wicked: but hee vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Church and children, more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially with his grace, and loue as a mother, or nurse the child, which is like to fall: this vpholding or establishing, is vnderstoode heere.</p>
               <p>Now this is the assistance of the holy Ghost, whereby the child of God is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held daily in the duties of the worship of God, and his perticuler calling.</p>
               <p>This hath alwayes in it. 1. truth, 2. fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation. 3. continuance, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially vnderstoode.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Free,</hi> doth signifie, that which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines call ingenious, which hath in it, 1. honesty, 2. cheerefulnes.</p>

               <p>Teach, a man is said to doe, when he causeth to learne. This a man doth, 1, by example: 2. in deede: 3. in word.</p>

               <p>Here we must vnderstand it of word &amp; example: 1, so as that we must speak things of instruction to others: 2. be the first our selues that must doe them: 3, now what kinde of teaching this should be, looke psalm 32.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So as that euery one shoulde bee carefull of the saluation of each other, &amp; this worke may beseeme a King, beeing as carefull to teach as to correct.</p>

               <p>Both may be well vnderstood in this place, so as that sinners ought to knowe how God dealeth with conuerts, and what course is to be taken, to continue in the pleasing of God.</p>

Some vnderstand it here, for that change which is in man, from the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his owne wretchednes and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to the mercy of God: this is true, but not sufficient and full.</p>
               <p>But I take it to be vnderstoode in the second sence, as most often in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Prophet most fitly setteth it out by turning to God.</p>
               <p>Turning vnto, implieth a former tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, as indeede euery sinner is out of the way, whatsoeuer they seeme to themselues, or others.</p>
               <p>This turning is indeede a change, not of the substance, nor of the powers, but only of die properties in desires &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of the soule and body.</p>
               <p>The qualities and properties, which must be in a party throughly turned to God, are of the faculties, 1, to fit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to theyr proper obiects, as to knowe, remember, see, and heare, &amp;c. that which it shoulde: 2. to doe theyr
<pb facs="tcp:14909:60"/>duties in them cheerefully, and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>This turning is to God, which is, whē a man in all things consulteth with the worde of God, and endeuoureth to doe all thereafter, neuer giuing ouer till in some sort he can so doe.</p>
               <p>But that we may the better vnderstand this turning, let vs consider the causes, the parts, the properties, and the markes of it.</p>
               <p>The principall, efficient, or making cause, is the Spirit of GOD, making a man a new. Iere. 31.18.</p>
               <p>The instrumentall, is the word of god.</p>
               <p>The matter, is the whole man in soule and body.</p>
               <p>The forme, is according to the image of God.</p>
               <p>The vtmost end, the glory of God: other middle ends, I, to certifie our own consciences touching our adoption: 2. to the edifying of our brethren.</p>
               <p>The properties are many.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It beginneth from within, and is most carefull to haue the hart first tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God.</item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14909:60"/>
                  <item>2. It neuer can long lie hid, though it desire not much to shew it selfe.</item>
                  <item>3. It is alwayes increasing, auoyding the sinnes the party is most inclined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: endeuouring for graces and duties most necessary.</item>
                  <item>4. In this life it is imperfect.</item>
                  <item>5. It is wise, &amp; maketh great account of great, and smaller thinges, so prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the duties of the worship of God, as it neglecteth not the duties of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler calling; and so performeth them, as yet the hart is principally to God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The parts are, mortification, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uification.</p>
               <p>Mortification, is the continuall lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the practise and power of sinne, and striketh all it can, at originall sin.</p>
               <p>Viuification, is actually renuing and quickning to all holy duties, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the good desire, purpose, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to do well, recouering it selfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter slips.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the properties, which cannot be perceiued easily in all.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Cannot be found in them who are not conuerted.</item>

                  <item>2. Not easily in such as bee babes in Christ.</item>
                  <item>3. Not in any, while they are in the fit of grieuous temptations, especially, of perticularities.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In others they may be found, some of them are;
<list>
                     <item>1. A willingnes to set a mans selfe in the presence of God, to thinke of death, the law, the latter iudgement, &amp; hell.</item>
                     <item>2. A true hatred of sin, yea, of euery sin, and that in a mans owne selfe.</item>
                     <item>3. A desire of spirituall nourishment by the Word, and Sacraments.</item>
                     <item>4. A loue of such as are trulie conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</item>
                     <item>5. A delight in heauenly things, and preferring them before the world.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Que. But heere a question may arise, whether sinners, when they knewe that Dauid was againe in fauour with God, did conuert?</p>
               <p>Aun. Dauid speaketh not so much of the effect, as of the sufficient cause, and iust occasion: that it is hard for a man by the effect, to iudge that the meanes were neuer vsed. Good meanes may make
<pb facs="tcp:14909:61"/>one presume of a good end.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Now, if Dauid deemed, that vpon his finding fauour with God, sinners would turne, what might we doe vpon so many and great meanes?</item>
                  <item>2. Besides, Dauid sheweth, that the best thing for a sinner to doe, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert.</item>
                  <item>3. And that, if sinners conuert vpon the knowledge of Gods mercy to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, how would the godly profit?</item>
               </list>
               <p>Hetherto hath beene the digression, now followeth a feruent pericion in the former part of the 14. verse. Whereof are two parts.</p>
               <p>The thing it selfe, and the Authour of the gyft.</p>
               <p>The thing, is to bee deliuered from blood. Some learned Interpreters, by bloods, vnderstand tragicall examples, and bloody euents in Dauids stock and house: but they cannot well proue this. I thinke, it signifieth man-slaughter and murder. For Dauid now thought vpon the murdering of his most faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt Vriah, and slaughter of the other in his band. Thus are bloods often taken
<pb facs="tcp:14909:62"/>in the Scriptures. Gene. 4.10.</p>
               <p>Dauid prayeth, that the fact be not laid to his charge. After generall confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, a man must come to particulers.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Let vs then learne from hence, that seeing Dauid was aboue the compasse of mans law, and yet calleth himselfe to a reckoning for sinne by the worde of God, others so ought to doe.</item>
                  <item>2. What an horrible sin murder is.</item>
                  <item>3. Particuler sins knowne, must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly be confessed.</item>
                  <item>4. The same sinnes wil often recourse, and accuse the conscience.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Authour followeth; vvho is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, with a speciall fauour of his.</p>
               <p>The Authour is God, and is heere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, as a note of fayth and boldnes in the Prophet, whereby he sheweth, that God can and will, and that Dauid loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for helpe.</p>
               <p>And the Prophet doth the rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate it, 1, to affect himselfe with consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods maiestie, 2. &amp; to stirre himselfe vp to pray with his hart, 3. and withall, to shew howe impatient fayth is of delayes.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:62"/>
               <p>Nowe this fauour, is saluation, 1. of soule, 2. of body.</p>
               <p>Hetherto hath beene the second spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of this Psalme, in petitions.</p>
               <p>Nowe followeth the third, which is, thanksgiuing: from the latter part of the 14. verse, to the 18.</p>
               <p>To this praysing, is there a passage made. ver. 14, 15, and a setting downe of the duty of praysing, in the rest.</p>
               <p>The passage hath the profession of this duty, and correction of the speech.</p>
               <p>The profession is in the latter part of the 14. verse, and hath in it. 1. the kind of duty. 2. the instrument. 3. the matter.</p>
               <p>The kind of duty, is singing with ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, which hath great vehemencie, boldnes, and cheerefulnes.</p>
               <p>Vehemencie, is in earnest setting of the minde.</p>
               <p>Boldnes, in perswasion, that the duty pleaseth God.</p>
               <p>Cheerefulnes, is whereby, we readily vpon the occasion giuen, breake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the prayses of God, and are glad, that we haue occasion so to doe.</p>
               <p>The instrument, is the tongue, the
<pb facs="tcp:14909:63"/>minde is not sufficient. 1. God will haue the whole man. 2. others must likewise by vs be prouoked.</p>
               <p>Neither did the tongue only sing, but the hand plaied, so must we, all the waies wee can, testifie our desires of praysing God: but some man may say, What dooth musicke helpe, to the prayse of God?</p>
               <p>Aunsw. Nothing simply. 1. by it the minde of the singer is shewed. 2. and sometime the minde dull, is stirred vp.</p>
               <p>The matter, is the righteousnes of god. This is the Dittie of his song.</p>
               <p>The iustice of God, doth heere signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, the truth of God, in keeping his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. as Rom. 3, 25, 26. to wit, towards sinners repenting: so likewise in the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian tongue, iustice is put for mercy.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Now Dauid thus singeth, euen in the house of his pilgrimage. Psal. 119.54.</item>
                  <item>2. He doth not therfore sing amarous songs.</item>
                  <item>3. Now indeede as all the statutes are to be our songs, that is, our delight to meditate in, so especially Gods promises of mercy toward repentant sinners.</item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14909:63"/>
                  <item>4. May not this be some comfort, that he calleth Gods mercy iustice: so as that hee shoulde not be iust, if hee were not mercifull to sinners, according to his promises?</item>
               </list>
               <p>Hetherto the profession of duty, now followeth the correction of speech. <hi>Open my lippes, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein the Prophet closely reprooueth himselfe, in that, hee professed his endeuour of praysing god, whereas indeede this is the gift of God; so as that vnlesse God open the mouth, we cannot praise him.</p>
               <p>This correction or mending of the speech, ascribeth all to God, the act, <hi>of opening the lippes,</hi> and the effect, <hi>my mouth shall shew thy praise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Open my lippes,</hi> is a part for the whole, the Prophet prayeth for ability, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to praise God.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. No man of himselfe alone, can rightly praise God, naturall corruption will stop his mouth.</item>
                  <item>2. If a man cannot open his lippes to praise God aright. 2. much lesse can he direct his hart to please God. 3. surely he cannot compasse his outward man.</item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14909:64"/>
                  <item>3. And if a man cannot rightly open his mouth, let him not be hasty with it. Eccle. 5, 1.</item>
                  <item>4. How earnest would this man be to haue his hart ordered.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The effect followeth, wherein is, 1. the instrument, mouth. 2. the worke, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the praise of God.</p>
               <p>Praysing, is acknowledging or witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of excellencie.</p>
               <p>God is most excellent euery way.</p>
               <p>Shewing forth, hath. 1. often repeating. 2. perticuler reckoning, 3. cleerely set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe.</p>
               <p>All which, we ought towards God to performe.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the passage to the praise. Now followeth the setting down of the praise or thanksgiuing.</p>
               <p>And that after two sorts, first, by way of deniall, then by affirming.</p>
               <p>Both the denial &amp; the affirming haue, 1. the thing. 2. the reason.</p>
               <p>That which is the deniall, is in these words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou desirest no sacrifice, though I would giue. Thou delightest not in burnt offerings:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14909:64"/>this part denieth the vnsufficient thing, to praise God. 1. by sacrifice. 2, by burnt offering.</p>
               <p>The reason, for that God is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with sacrifice, neyther wisheth burnt offerings.</p>
               <p>I thinke the verse might better be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished thus. Thou art not deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with sacrifice, thou desirest no burnt offering, though I would giue it.</p>
               <p>For the speech encreaseth, greater is burnt offering, than sacrifice.</p>
               <p>But first knowe the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>Sacrifice, properly so called, is a part of the Iewish worship of God, whereby somewhat was offered to God.</p>
               <p>It was of two sorts, 1. Propitiatorie, to procure fauour with God. 2, Gratulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to witnes, thanksgiuing to God.</p>
               <p>The second is meant in this place, and that was sometimes called sacrifice, when some beast was killed, but part was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for the offerer, part for the Priest, part offered to God.</p>
               <p>That which in English is translated desirest, were better, art not delighted
<pb facs="tcp:14909:65"/>with, spoken after the manner of men: that is, doest neither commaund, that I should offer it, nor doost so approue of it, when I offer it.</p>
               <p>That which is translated, delightest not in, were better wilt not, that is, doest not care for. We are wisely for all this, to vnderstand this denial: for it may seeme strange, that God should not like of that which himselfe commaunded, as sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and burnt offerings, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>First, therefore God liketh not these sacrifices onely, and for the deede done, as sundry performed them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He liketh them not so much, as he doth the other, of a broken hart: for so denialls are by way of comparison. Look Hos. 6, 6. Ioel, 2, 13.1, Pet, 1, 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God liketh them not, as the Iewes many times performed them. Isa, 1, and 66. chapters.</p>
               <p>Que. Did the Iewes rest onely in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thinges, and had not those of the life to come?</p>
               <p>Did the Iewes rest in outward things, without euerlasting life?</p>
               <p>Aun. No, the elect Iewes enioy euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb facs="tcp:14909:65"/>life, as well as any of vs shall.</p>
               <p>Quest: What difference is betweene the Iewes and the Christians this way?</p>
               <p>Aun: In the maine matters of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing, the same God, the same Christ, the same spirit, the same worde, the same faith, hope, and charity, &amp;c. In outwarde thinges somewhat; they had more Sacraments than the Christians: the outward matter of them was diuers, the continuance was not for euer, as the Christians are. Things were not so cleare among them, as among the Christians.</p>
               <p>Quest: Why did God ordaine that, which after he did abolish?</p>
               <p>Aun: The fulnes of time was not yet come, and God would break the proud hart of the Iewes, by these so many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1, By this, wee may perceaue, that a man may doe duties, which God hath commaunded, &amp; yet not please God.</item>
                  <item>2, That nothing wil please God from vs onely, for the deede done, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motion of the minde, with faith in Christ, with desire to please God by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements.</item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14909:66"/>
                  <item>3. Sometimes it so may fall out, that a man may omit som outward duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great fault.</item>
                  <item>4, When there is some cause, that somewhat of the worship should not be performed, neuer omit the spirituall.</item>
                  <item>5, If in Dauids time sacrifices were not alwayes needfull, what shall we now thinke after Christ, of the abhominable sacrifice of the Masse.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Hetherto the part denying: now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the affirming part, shewing what are the most acceptable sacrifices to god. Now this part hath in it, the reckoning vp of these sacrifices, and the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them.</p>
               <p>The commendation sheweth that, 1, they are sacrifices, that is, in steede of all, 2, of God, 3, such as God despiseth not.</p>
               <p>The spirit and hart signifie as before, in verse, 10. <hi>Broken,</hi> and <hi>Contrite:</hi> spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches taken from things, beaten into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers peeces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contrite,</hi> beaten as it were to dust or powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Broken,</hi> is opposite to solide and hard,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:66"/>vvhich yeeldeth vvith much adoe: of which fort, is euery mans hart by nature. Hence are these speeches, A brasen fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, an yron sinew.</p>
               <p>The better to know what this contrite hart is, let vs first set downe what it is, 2, how it is gotten, 3. how it is tried.</p>
               <p>A contrite heart, is voyde of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of it owne worthines. Luke, 10.</p>
               <p>It thinketh it selfe worthy of any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. Eze. 20, 43.</p>
               <p>It esteemeth all it owne thinges most base. Esay, 6, 41, Phil. 3.</p>
               <p>It followeth the word of God into all formes. Nehe. 8.9.</p>
               <p>It is comforted at the least signe of Gods fauour. 2, Reg, 20, 19.</p>
               <p>It is cast down at the least signe of his displeasure. 2, Reg. 22, 19.</p>
               <p>It is easily vpon iust occasion, moued with affections of loue, feare, ioy, hope, &amp;c. Psal, 12, 4.2, Sam. 15. Psal. 119 often.</p>
               <p>It is alwayes full of pitty to others. Ier. 9.2, Cor. 11.</p>
               <p>It maketh conscience of smal thinges. Psalm, 19.</p>
               <p>It is gotten, onely by the worke of the
<pb facs="tcp:14909:67"/>holy Ghost. Eze. 11, 19. Ioh. 3.6.</p>
               <p>The Spirit worketh, 1, without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in infants, as in Iohn Baptist. 2. By meanes of the Word, preparatorily, and effectinglie.</p>
               <p>The Law prepareth, the Gospel fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, and worketh grace, as Nilus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Egipt fruitful. Heereupon it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ministrie of the Spirit. 2, Cor. 3.</p>
               <p>A helping cause to these, are 1, priuity to a mans owne sinnes, infirmities, and slips; these keepe the hart the softer. 2. The crosse sanctified, as in Dauid and Ezechias.</p>
               <p>Now heere is breaking and contrition in two degrees, to teach vs, howe we are to proceede, not to rest in a little brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but to goe vnto grinding.</p>

Luke. 7.</item>

               <p>The commendation remaineth, first, that these are sacrifices; that is, one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hart is as good, nay better, then all the sacrifices in the world.</p>
               <p>They are of God, that is, most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as the hill of God, trees of GOD, noate an excellencie. They are the more excellent, for that they are, 1, of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test price: 2, most harde to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: 3, most rare.</p>
               <p>God despiseth them not: it is a kinde of speech, where more then is spoken is vnderstoode. <hi>Thou despisest not:</hi> that is, thou maketh great account of. Esay, 57.15. So as none broken in hart, should be discouraged, since God doth like them.</p>
               <p>Hetherto hath beene the greatest and first part of this Psalme, for the Prophet himselfe, nowe followeth that which is
<pb facs="tcp:14909:68"/>for the whole Church, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 18. verse, to the end of the 19, whereof are two parts, 1, peticions: 2. prayses.</p>
               <p>Peticions, for Sion and Ierusalem.</p>
               <p>The peticions for Sion, is to be fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Sion for thy good pleasure.</p>
               <p>Wherein are, 1, the thing, fauour: 2, the manner: for thy, or according to thy good pleasure.</p>
               <p>But first wee may perceiue, it is our part to pray for others, as well as for our selues: 1, because of Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: 2, for that we are the better if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be well: 3, we are members of one body, and God is all our Father: 4, but Dauid dooth this more particulerly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee might feare, that for his sake, God would afflict Sion and Ierusalem.</p>
               <p>Sion was the hill in the Cittie of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, where afterward was built the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and now was the Tabernacle. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be put heere for Church, and in that, 1, for persons: 2. for things.</p>
               <p>Persons, are especially those, who are of the houshold of faith, and 1. those pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who beget to Sion, as faythfull
<pb facs="tcp:14909:68"/>Ministers furnished, and endeuouring to instruct in wholesome doctrine: not Wolues, not hirelings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nurcing Fathers &amp; Mothers, Kings Queenes, and Magistrates.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Daughters of Sion, perticuler con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Those hee prayeth may first multiply, and secondly florish, for the Churches good.</p>
               <p>The thinges are, 1, publishing of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing doctrine: 2, frequenting holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, for exercise of the word, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Sacraments. 3. VVithstanding heresies. 4. Procuring godly gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</p>
               <p>The thing, <hi>Be fauourable,</hi> that is, giue these things: 2, continue them: 3, blesse them.</p>
               <p>The maner, <hi>For thy good pleasure,</hi> not for our merrits. 2, In what measure thou thinkest good.</p>
               <p>The peticion for Ierusalem foloweth, wherein we may consider, 1, the obiect, vvalls. 2. the act, build.</p>
               <p>Ierusalem, the chiefe Cittie of Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, first called Salem, Gene, 14, 18, Psalm, 7.6. After that, it was called Iebus.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:69"/>Iudg. 19.10 and of these two names, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem and Iebusalem: Though some thinke of the verbe <hi>Iire,</hi> and <hi>Shalom,</hi> which is, shal see peace, &amp; it is in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all number, as <hi>Ramathaiim.</hi> 1. Sam. 1.</p>
               <p>With this was after ioyned the citie of Dauid, so were there three cities in one.</p>
               <p>Nowe this was once the ioy of the whole earth. Looke Psalme, 48, 1, 2, 3, and is taken properly, for the Cittie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named: improperly, for heauenly or earthly Ierusalem.</p>
               <p>In this place it is taken both wayes, for the City that then was, and a politicall state of the people of GOD for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as Esay, 2, 3. Psalm, 112, 3, 6.</p>
               <p>A political state is a company of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple well ordered, and furnished vvith things necessary for this present life.</p>
               <p>Which may fitly be resembled to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem: because, 1, that as Ierusalem had, so other states should haue Lawes from God: 2. that as in that Citie, so in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers God shoulde as it were keepe his Court: 3, where shoulde as it were keepe his Court: 3, where should be likewise the pure worship of God.</p>
               <p>Forget not then that outward thinges
<pb facs="tcp:14909:69"/>come from God.</p>
               <p>That wee are to hang vppon him for them by fayth.</p>
               <p>So to seeke outward things, as chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue care, for that which is for the common good.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Cittie, for which the prayer is made: now followeth the object and speciall thing prayed for: The walls of Ierusalem.</p>
               <p>Walls, before gunnes were inuented, were the chiefe strength of the Citty: so as heere they are mentioned, for that which is the surest and safest.</p>

               <p>The thanksgiuing foloweth, verse 19. wherein is mention made 1, of the duty, 2, of the acceptance.</p>
               <p>The duty is one and the selfe same of giuing prayse, and yet set downe in 4. branches: 1, offring sacrifices of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes: 2, burnt offrings: 3, oblations: 4, offring of Calues.</p>
               <p>Acceptance, <hi>Thou shalt accept them.</hi>

               <p>Such are offered according to the intent of Gods iust law.</p>
               <p>In that whole burnt offerings were in prayse, we may perceaue, that we ought likewise to prayse God, 1. feruently, 2. with the whole heart, 3. though it be to our cost.</p>
               <p>The acceptance is such, as God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mislike them. Looke Psal. 50, 25.</p>
               <p>So as vpon this acceptance, Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should be encouraged to continue their duty of offering prayses, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young bullocks.</p>

            <head>An exposition vpon the tenne <hi>Commaundements.</hi> (∴)</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll mans happines is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, God maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe knowne by his word: a part whereof is the morrall law, imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the first in Adam and Eues hart. After that, when that the light of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to vveare away, it was proclaimed to the world, engrauen in stone, kept for record in the Arke of the testimonie, in opening and applying whereof, most of the deuine Writerse did spend their time: Euen Christ himselfe came to teach it, &amp; doe it, and of it one iote or title cannot possible faile. It shall keepe the vse that euer it had since the fall, to the generall resurrection, and therefore is as needfull now to be vnderstoode, as at any time. It is commonly called, the Decalogue, or ten wordes, or Commaundements, for
<pb facs="tcp:14909:72"/>that there be ten. The morrall law, for that it setteth downe all duties for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of mankinde, of all sorts and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: sometimes the lawe, for that it is the abstract &amp; abridgement of all lawes for humane behauiour, meaning though the morrall law, not the law in generall, and is set downe in the 20. chap. of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, frō the beginning of the first verse, to the end of the 17. verse. In all those verses are two thinges, the one, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the commaundements, the other, the treatise &amp; Commaundements themselues. The entrance, is in the two first verses, for the more orderly setting downe of the commaundements: and is likewise double according, 1, to the Register, 2. to the Author of the law.</p>
            <p>The Register or Recorder of this law heere, is Moses, who hauing set downe in the former chapter, some preparatiues for things to be done, in this 20, chap. in the beginning of this, passeth on imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things done before, withall, setting downe that which is to follow.</p>
            <p>He implieth thinges done before, in the first word, <hi>then,</hi> whereby he sheweth,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:72"/>that as those before were necessary, yet were they not sufficient, for somewhat else is required.</p>
            <p>He setteth downe, that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in these words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then God spake all these words, and said.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein were may consider, 1. the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 2. the appurtenances.</p>
            <p>The matter is, <hi>these words,</hi> that is the sentences following in the meaning of them: so as that they must needes be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, seeing God thought no scorne to publish them, and they cannot but be hard to men, as we are, comming from such an infinite wisedome, as is in God.</p>
            <p>The appurtenances bee diuers, first, of the time, <hi>then,</hi> that is, after the things mentioned in the former chapter, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is, that the whole people were called together neither till then, was the law published.</p>
            <p>Where-vpon as then, so alwayes must we know, that not onely all the people of God, but also all mankinde should take knowledge heereof.</p>
            <p>Another is, that they should sanctifie themselues, verse 10. that is, vse due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para
<pb facs="tcp:14909:73"/>paration to come before God, and heare his word: so was Moses before bid to pluck off his shooes. Exo. 3, 5. so Iosua, 5.15. against this, offended the Iewes. Acts, 7, 51. being of vncircumcised harts and eares: for indeed all being vncleane and vntoward, had neede of most clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and fitting.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Nowe this preparation, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, some ceremonies were vsed, is, in freeing and disburdening our mindes, not onely of vnlawfull busines, but euen of those of outward callinges perticuler.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Presenting our selues, and duties before GOD, in the righteousnes of Christ.</p>
            <p>Praying to God, as to forgiue our want of preparation. 2, Chro. 30.19. so to assist vs with his spirit, as that we may performe our duty, in attending vppon his ordinances, to the pleasing of God, and that he may direct all the busines for our good, and we our endeuour to his glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third, is the disposition of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they all were afraid at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:14909:73"/>of that thunder and noyse, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fire: so is God wont to doe, the readier to procure reuerence to cast men downe, as Elias, Saule, &amp;c. So as that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse wee be humble, in a sence of our own vnworthines, we are not fit to heare any part of Gods word.</p>
            <p>The second appurtenance, is, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son deliuering this law, and that is, the Lord God himselfe, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, attended vpon with milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels. Acts, 7, 53. Gal. 3, 19. so that there is neuer an idle worde, but all full of wonderfull wisedome.</p>
            <p>The third, is the manner of deliuerie of this law. <hi>God spake:</hi> that is, in a sound of words, as <hi>Moses</hi> telleth. Deu. 5, 24. that they heard a voyce; In vvhich sence (I take it) Stephen calleth them liuely Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Acts, 7, 37. for that they were vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by liuely voyce: not that they did giue life; for Moses himselfe was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully amazed. Heb. 12, 21. and Paule sheweth, 2, Cor. 3, 6. that the law was the ministerie of death. So as that the best way of attending to the lawe, is by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14909:74"/>
            <p>The fourth, is the perfection of it, not leauing out one, so as that what God hath commaunded, who dare but after the same manner publish.</p>
            <p>The fift &amp; last, is implied in this word, <hi>saying,</hi> which meaneth distinctly, treata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that euery one might take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as of the words, so of the meaning of this law.</p>
            <p>Thus much for Moses entrance, now followeth that of God himselfe, and is in the 2. verse, and consisteth of reasons, which might preuaile with the hearers of this law, to giue attendance thereto, and yeeld obedience.</p>
            <p>The first reason, is this, his law who is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> that is, the onely true God, is to be attended and obeyed: this law which thou hearest, is mine, the onely true God and <hi>Iehouah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therfore it is to be attended vnto and obeyed, there can be no doubt in any of this, and therefore God himselfe stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not further to proue it, but onely is content barely to set it downe.</p>
            <p>The second reason is, from the diuers and great benefits, which God bestowed
<pb facs="tcp:14909:74"/>vpon them, &amp; may be thus framed: his lawe who hath bestowed most excellent benefits vpon you, ought to be attended vnto and obeyed. I, who deliuer thys law, haue so done by you: therfore, &amp;c. Nowe what force benefits haue, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with the receiuers for al obedience, because it is cleere, God dooth not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proue. It were enough for God to commaund, but to preuent with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, would breake any good natured hart.</p>
            <p>Now the benefits which GOD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon them, are mentioned to be of two sorts, generall, or more speciall.</p>
            <p>Generall, is that which is the fountaine of all: viz. Gods couenaunt made with his people, and may be set out after this maner. I, who haue taken you to be my people, and haue promised to be <hi>Iehoua</hi> your God, you must attende and obey my law: but it is thus betweene you and me, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in this benefit, another speciall reason is implied from the profession of the people: For howsoeuer God coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunteth with his people, yet vnlesse
<pb facs="tcp:14909:75"/>they againe, couenaunt to take him for their God it is not sufficient. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God meaneth this, that they coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunting to take <hi>Iehoua</hi> for theyr God, must attend &amp; obey his law. But so they haue done, therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And surely, there cannot be any so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall reason, to enforce all obedience to Gods lawe, as this. For taking God to be our God, we cannot but performe all fealtie vnto him. This profession haue our Parents made for vs, and we for our selues in Sacraments and prayers.</p>
            <p>More speciall, are such as by name here are reckoned vp; and those two, not but that God had bestowed more vpon thē, but because, 1, these were very fresh in their memorie: 2, and in these, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly shewed himselfe to be true, and theyr God, by his wonderfull power in miracles, and strange works; by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of his promises vttered so long before, for their entring &amp; going out of Egypt many hundred of yeeres before: by his wonderful kindnes towards them, in so preseruing, multiplying, &amp; deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them: 3, they were in themselues
<pb facs="tcp:14909:75"/>of speciall excellencie and worth.</p>
            <p>The first of these, is, <hi>Bringing out of the land of Egipt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Egipt, in it selfe had many and great commodities, but heere it is considered, as giuen to idolatry, &amp; euen of the worst kinde, to worship Crocodiles, Cats, yea Onyons &amp; Garlick, and most base crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; so as that the Israelites coulde not liue among them with good cōscience: neither would the Egiptians suffer the Israelites (by theyr good wills) to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe God, otherwise then themselues did: so that deliuerance frō hence, must needes be a great fauour; where to haue doone as others, would bring no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of cōscience, but hell for afterward, &amp; to haue done otherwise, had brought certaine outward danger. Exod, 8, 26.</p>
            <p>Well therefore doth God reckon vp this fauour, as to teach what an intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing it is, to liue among idolaters, and what a speciall fauour to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from amongst them. VVhere no meanes of saluation are, all sinnes raigne, and where, if one be once entrapped, it is most hard to wind out.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14909:76"/>
            <p>In no lesse slauery then this, were the Churches in Romish Egipt, so as that deliuerance from thence, ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile alike. For surely, the Masse, images, reliques, bread, &amp;c. are as vile Idols as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were among the Egiptians: the same may be saide, for all such as are vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, that their slauerie is very great.</p>
            <p>The second benefit is, <hi>Bringing out of the house of bondage, or seruaunts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the former is spirituall, this is bodily, implying the many vexations which the Israelites were faine to beare, by the tyrannie of the Egiptians: &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause slauery or bondage is most heauie to an ingenious nature, therefore this is named for the others.</p>
            <p>For, besides the tedious buildings, theyr making of brick, gathering straw, and beeing corrected, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to cast out theyr young chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to death, &amp;c. so as that deliuerance from hence, was a very great fauour.</p>
            <p>Whereupon marke, that euen bodilie fauours, must not be forgotten. Wee all haue greater, so as our obedience had neede to be more.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14909:76"/>
            <p>Thus much of the entrance vvhich God makth: now followeth the treatise and Cōmaundements themselues, from the beginning of the 3. verse, to the end of the 17. For the profitable vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereof, somwhat is to be known, before we come by peece-meale to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider thereof; And this is in certaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall directions, as that.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This lawe requireth full obedience of the whole man: the whole man, I call soule &amp; body, with euery part &amp; power thereof.</p>
            <p>Full obedience, doth signifie, 1, euery parcel of obedience: 2, in the fullest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thereof: 3, in the longest continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as the nature of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This law, by some one particuler or part, meaneth the generall &amp; whole. As an <hi>Idoll,</hi> is put for any meanes of false worship. <hi>Parents,</hi> for all betters. <hi>Killing,</hi> for any hindering of life. &amp;c. <hi>Then,</hi> for euery one, or none.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The forbidding Cōmaundements, imply the contrary affirming, as, <hi>Thou shalt haue no other Gods. &amp;c.</hi> that is, thou
<pb facs="tcp:14909:77"/>shalt haue me for thy God. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And affirming Commaundements, imply the denying contrary, as, <hi>Keepe holy the Sabboth,</hi> that is, doe not breake it. <hi>Honour thy Father,</hi> that is, doe not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All estates &amp; persons, are bound to keepe this law, none exempt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is a manner of speech, <hi>shalt not,</hi> for maiest not haue, or oughtest not, the second future for the first, or future tence for the Imparatiue moode.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Such as can keepe this lawe in the perfection of it, shall be blessed; such as breake it neuer so little, deserue to be damned in hell, in euerlasting misery for euer.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For such as are not turned to God, it serueth to humble them, and driue thē to Christ.</p>
            <p n="8">8. For such as are turned, it is a rule of life.</p>
            <p n="9">9. None can dispence againe this, but only God; neither in whole nor in part.</p>
            <p n="10">10. No creature can fully see into the depth of the doctrine, and particulers contained in this law.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:14909:77"/>
            <p>These are some generall directions, the Commaundements remaine in the sum, sorts, and number of them.</p>
            <p>The sum of all, is loue.</p>
            <p>This loue, is toward God or men, frō whence ariseth the sorts and numbers of the Commaundements, which likewise are deuided into two Tables, as Deut. 5.22. Heb. 9, 4.</p>
            <p>These were two (as it were) leaues of stone: Some Rabbines vvrite, of most precious stone, written by God himselfe on both sides, within &amp; without, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thē afterward the Iewes were wont to write in rolls) kept for afterwarde as records.</p>
            <p>In the former Table, are such duties commaunded as we owe vnto God, and hath Commaundements 4. from the 3. verse, to the end of the 11. In the second Table, are the other.</p>
            <p>The Commaundements of the first Table, are touching mans loue &amp; dutie towards God, &amp; enioyne the hauing of God for our God, and the worshipping of him.</p>
            <p>The hauing of God, is commaunded,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:78"/>verse 3. The worshipping of him, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.11.</p>
            <p>The Commaundement vvhich is for the hauing of GOD, Christ calleth the first and the greatest commaundement. Math, 22.38. And first, for that from it, all others in nature flowe. First must a man haue God, and then worship him. Secondly, for that it is impossible, that a man should well vnderstand the other, without this.</p>
            <p>It is called great, for that the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and vse thereof, is of great importance; as also, for that it is one of the hardest to be kept, &amp; stretcheth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie far.</p>
            <div n="1" type="commandment">
               <head>The 1. Commaundement.</head>
               <p>This Commaundement is, <hi>Thou shalt haue no other Gods, &amp;c.</hi> In which we may consider the wordes, and then the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Our English, <hi>Thou shalt not haue,</hi> is in Hebrew, <hi>There shall not be to thee.</hi> Shall not be, for may not be, or ought not to be: so as if there be, thou sinnest. So likewise, Shall not haue, must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, Oughtest not to haue. And these words, <hi>to thee,</hi> is not onely to thy
<pb facs="tcp:14909:78"/>selfe, but to any of thine, or any by thy meanes or occasion, whom thou mayest lawfully hinder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Other Gods.</hi> It may be as well reade, <hi>God as Gods:</hi> for though the worde in Hebrew be of the plurall number, yet it signifieth singulerly, and one: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, one worshipping; but any other strange God, though hee worship not many, breaketh this law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Other,</hi> that is, besides, or with the true <hi>Iehouah,</hi> who I am: and those whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be, are not Gods, but so called, as saith Paul, 1, Cor. 8.5. Though there be that are called Gods, whether in heauen or in earth, as there be many Gods and many Lords: yet vnto vs there is but one God. And therefore this name GOD, is giuen to them, according to the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and manner of speech in the world: Of this kinde, were there sundry in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, as Cats, Crocodiles, &amp;c. and other in other Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before me:</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>Before my face,</hi> which manner of speech, is often in the Scriptures, taken from men, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to God. Nowe in the face, are the
<pb facs="tcp:14909:79"/>eyes, which in men are meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, so as that the face in this sence, sundry times is vsed of GOD, for his knowledge, as Gen 6, 11, and 10, 9. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God or his face, that is, in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Nowe likewise, because Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is euery where, looke Psal. 139.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. in which respect, sundry learned men haue saide. God is all eye, because he knoweth all things: therfore Gods meaning is, that they should not haue any Gods at all, so as he may know, and nothing can they doe, but hee will know, therefore must they haue none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>These are the words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning is, in the matter contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the sum whereof, is this: <hi>Thou must haue me to be thy God, and none other.</hi> And heere are two parts, the one, affirming what we ought to doe, the other, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and forbidding. The affirming is, <hi>Thou must haue me to be thy God:</hi> The which, is more largely set downe. Deut. 6, 5. Iosh. 24, 15. Math. 4.10.</p>
               <p>Now this giueth vs to consider, 1, of the persons: 2, of the dutie.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:79"/>
               <p>Persons, who is to haue, and whom to haue: who is to haue, <hi>thou,</hi> that is, no party in the worlde, of whom it may be said, <hi>thou,</hi> as before.</p>
               <p>The person whom we are to haue is set downe in this word <hi>me,</hi> who is heere the speaker, and setteth out himselfe in the Scripture, one God, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, eternall, omnipotent, infinite, most iust, most mercifull, &amp;c. maker of heauen and earth. Looke Exo. 34.6, 7.</p>
               <p>This God must be vnderstood alone, as Mark. 12.29. Deut. 6, 4. Math. 4, 10. Iosh. 24, 9.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, that in the 2. of the Kinges, 17, 33. the people feared the Lord, but serued their Gods, after the manner of the Nations whom they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thence.</p>
               <p>Aunswer. The Author doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that the people so doing, did well, but he only sheweth what they did: and therefore, Zeph. 1, 5. God threatneth to cut off the remnant of them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and sweare by the Lord, and sweare by Malcham, that is, giue any respect to
<pb facs="tcp:14909:80"/>any other: neither indeede can there be any fellowship betweene Christ and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall.</p>
               <p>The duty is, to hane this <hi>Iehouah,</hi> the true God, for our God: this <hi>hauing,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more than it soundeth. In the world a man may haue that, which he doth not regard nor vse. It is not so heere; for so must we haue God, as that we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect him as God, and vse him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: in which sence Dauid speaketh. Psal. 73, 25. Whom haue I in heauen but thee? and I haue desired none in the earth with thee.</p>
               <p>And heere sundry things are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Taking knowledge of the will of this God, necessarie to euerlasting life: so Iohn, 17, 3. Ier. 24 7. this is onely out of the Scriptures a rightly vnderstoode: and with this knowledge, is ability to put difference betweene truth and falshood. Heb. 5, 14. Acknowledgment of the truth, and cleauing thereto. So Dauid required Salomon. 1, Chro. 28, 9. and for default heerein, Paule blameth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians. 1, Cor. 15, 34. yea, for the very
<pb facs="tcp:14909:80"/>want heereof in Hosea, God saith, Hee hath a controuersie with the Land, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea, 4, 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A deliberate preferring and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this God, aboue all the things in the world: so as that for him one can die and suffer any thing. Psal. 73, 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reuerence, as of our Father. Mala. 1, 6. this hath loathnes to displease, as in Ioseph. Gen. 39, 9. and carefulnes in all thinges to please God, and to doe his will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Trust and affiance in him, as rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the certainty of his word and promises: as Paule saith, I know whom I haue beleeued. 2. Tim. 1, 12. so that we commit our vvhole estate vp into his hands, &amp; trust him ouer all.</p>
               <p>Thys maketh vs patient vnder the crosse, and to wayte.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Loue, which maketh vs like all that he liketh, kindling a continuall and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent desire in vs, to enioy him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Recourse to him by prayer, vpon all occasions.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Returning to him alwayes all pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:81"/>
               <p>Indeede neuer shall we doe all enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this commaundement, till God be all in all vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the affirming part: now followeth the denying and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part, which forbiddeth any thing otherwise, then it is commaunded in the former part, &amp; may by it be vnderstood. Where we must remember, that neither none other God alone, beside the true God, or with the true God, is to be had for our God.</p>
               <p>This is the first Commaundement, for hauing GOD: the other which are for the pure worship of God followeth, and these are three, one, for the manner, the other, for the end, the third, for the time and place.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="commandment">
               <head>The 2. Commaundement.</head>
               <p>The first, which is, for the manner of the worshipping of this true God, is, ver. 4, 5, 6. Whereof there be two parts, the charge, and the sanction: the charge, in the 4. and part of the fift verse, in these wordes. <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe, &amp;c.</hi> The sanction in the rest, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 7. verse.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:81"/>
               <p>This charge forbiddeth all straunge manner of worshipping God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth the pure worship of him, and that both vnder one.</p>
               <p>In the charge, we may consider (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the person, and the duty.</p>
               <p>The person, <hi>thou,</hi> any reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The duty in the rest, and that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grauen image or similitude, &amp;c. in two degrees, first of making, the second of worshipping.</p>
               <p>The first degree, forbiddeth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any grauen image, &amp;c. Wherein we may consider, the action and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</p>
               <p>The action is, <hi>making,</hi> which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: making is set out by the party for whom, <hi>to thy selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Making,</hi> is to cause, or occasion first to be, to cause, or occasion, or permit, when one may lawfully hinder to vse, so as that Princes who doe but tollerate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure worship, are condemned: the like is of Parents, Maisters, &amp;c such others.</p>
               <p>It is said, <hi>Thou shalt not:</hi> for thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not, as before.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:82"/>
               <p>The party for whom <hi>to thy selfe,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth not onely ones selfe, but for any other whomsoeuer: so as that though a man doth not himselfe, but occasion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he sinneth.</p>
               <p>Now thy selfe art named, for that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie haue any care of Religion, it is first for his owne selfe.</p>
               <p>The obiect, is the thing forbidden to be made, <hi>grauen image, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Grauen image, properly is that which is cut or carued with a toole, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any thing made by Art: but heere wee must be warie; for it is not simply forbidden to carue or graue; then the Tabernacle had not beene so curiously wrought, nor Salomons temple, but this is to be vnderstoode in Gods meaning, and as the fashion of some, was to vse grauen images, to represent the true god by, or to worship him in them, or by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of them; the which is heere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and no otherwise: so as when he saith, no grauen image to set out God, or worship God, otherwise it is lawfull to graue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Similitude,</hi> is likenes, which is heere set
<pb facs="tcp:14909:82"/>out by the things the likenes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is forbidden. Similitude is put for any representation, either for the thing it selfe, or the representing of it, by painting, imbroydering, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: yea, for the likenes of it i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined in the mind, viz. to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent God, or worshippe him by it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it is not forbidden.</p>
               <p>The things whereof the likenes is forbidden are in heauen aboue, earth beneath, the water vnder the earth.</p>
               <p>That is indeed of any creature, for in these places are all creatures.</p>
               <p>The heauens signifie the Aire, as well as the starrie skie, so that birdes are meant: yea, the manhood of our Lord Iesus Christ and the Angels are meant.</p>
               <p>Where by it may appeare the holy ghost in likenes of a Doue, nor the auncient of dayes like an olde man should be purtrayed vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The second degree is for not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping these and that in two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the one not to bowe downe to them, the other not to serue them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:83"/>
               <p>This to bow downe is of gesture, and as I take it signifieth to fall down groueling in token of honour, and is put, for any outward signe of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the knee, of bodie, vncouering the head &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The other of seruing is by no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deed of marking our selues for them, speaking in honour of them, kissing them, or any such like to shew the least good respect of them.</p>
               <p>So as that now it may appeare the strange manner of worshipping of God is forbidden, vnder one speciall kind and the pure maner imployed thereby.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 This strange maner is forbiddē vnder the name of grauen Image and likenesse of other things: because that in these men did most offend.</item>
                  <item>2 Secondly, &amp; to these our natures most carrieth vs as we see in the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites who would haue a likenes.</item>
                  <item>3 And besides the Egyptians tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were full of such likenesses.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It would bee too long, to set downe both the strange and pure worship:
<pb facs="tcp:14909:83"/>the pure shall serue whereby we may iudge of the other. It is a reed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by all, that there is some straite rule of the pure worshippe of God whereto it must be framed, from whence if we swarue it cannot please God. The rule of Gods pure worship is his owne voice, will, and word, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sai. 29.13. Collo. 2.22.</hi> And that writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and registred in the Bible &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall bookes thereof, so as that whatsoeuer shall not haue warrant therefrom is not to be admitted, so as that all heathenish Idols; all Iewish ceremonies since Christs cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming must be remoued, yea all Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish pictures, crosses, blessings, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, Reliques, singings, &amp; such like not grounded on the word must away. All that the word teacheth for the pure manner of Gods worship, is either for the parts or parties of it, the parts are whereof all the whole worship of God doth consist, &amp; they be either more principall, or lesse principall. Principall are such as cannot be left vnperformed as is the
<pb facs="tcp:14909:84"/>ministerie and prayer. The ministery is an ordinance of God for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the word and Sacraments: the word of God, is truth of God set downe in the Bible read, opened in the meaning of it, applied to those of the hearers to worke in thē know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, repentance, and so euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting saluation by Christ.</p>
               <p>The Sacramentes are to confirme faith of saluation by Christ, as in old time circumcision the passouer, since Christ, baptisme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>Praier is seeking to God according to his will for the reliefe of wants, with thankes for fauours.</p>
               <p>Lesse principall are ceremonies, &amp; these outward actions ordayned by the church must haue:</p>
               <p n="1">1 First warrant and strength from the word.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They must be to Edification, 1. Cor. the 14.26.</p>
               <p>Edification is building vp, that is furthering to euerlasting saluation: and this is alwayes without scandall,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:84"/>scandall is an occasion giuen of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, besides it must be with respect of the weake, so as that cannot well be that all ceremonies should be the same to all euery where.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They must be comely. 1. Cor. 14.40. This comelynes seemeth to bee the agreement that ought to be bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these ceremonies and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall worship of God, whereto the more they agree, the more they are to be allowed and therefore that which men thinke comely and best for outward shewe is not alwaies the best.</p>
               <p n="4">4 They must be according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>These are the parts of worship, the properties may be gathered out of Iohn. 4.22.24. Isa. 66.3. they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</p>
               <p n="1">1 First knowledge that it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God, Rom. 14.23. euery one must be perswaded. Rom. 14.5.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14909:85"/>attire, attention and such like. Esa. 66.3. Malac. 1.8. Psal. 2.11.</p>

               <p>Hetherto hath beene the charge: The function followeth from the middle of the 5. ver. to the end of the 6. ver. wherein are reasons set downe the more to procure attention &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to this commaundement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why hath this commā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement reasons more then some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> For that this commmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is verie easily disobayed, and yet the disobedience, that is a most grieuous sinne in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>The reasons seeme to be foure.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The first the true God <hi>Iehouah</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14909:85"/>in all things must ye obay. I who am he, commaund you this, therefore in it you must obay me.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, whome you take to be your God you must obay, I am your God so shewing my selfe, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise acknowledged of you, therefore you must obay.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the strong God you were best to obay, I am he, therefore for so doth one of Gods names here signifie, strong and mightie, who can doe what hee will in reuenge of disobedience done vnto him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, God is iealous, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must be obayed, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of this reason, wee are to knowe that al do not vnderstand this worde iealous alike: the Hebrewe wherof it is, may be taken two waies iealous or zealous.</p>
               <p>Iealous is one who is greeued for suspition of dishonestie in his maried yoake-fellowe husband or wife, this some interpretors thinke to bee in God, as diuers times the worde is translated by them, and that by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb facs="tcp:14909:86"/>of the mariage band between God and his church: and likewise the force of ielousie whē it doth reuenge which seemeth somtime to bee in God: neuertheles be it with reuerēce to al that thinke otherwise with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes to be reformed, if I erre, I thinke it is not so here to be taken.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Ielous and zelous are not alwaies both, this word here signfieth both.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Ielousie is a fault and not to bee ascribed to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some very learned men as <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius</hi> and <hi>lunius</hi> take it for zealous.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It must be that here from whence commeth visiting the iniquities of the fathers, &amp;c. and shewing mercie, now ielousie neuer sheweth mercie.</p>
               <p>I read it therefore a zealous God, that is a God full of zeale, as <hi>Simon</hi> was called Zelotes, or Zealous.</p>
               <p>Zeale is a most earnest affection, or the great increase of an affection, loue, anger, hatred, so as wee heard before of Gods power, now we hear of his will, whereby he is most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to performe whatsoeuer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb facs="tcp:14909:86"/>himselfe, Ioel the second. So as in this zeale is.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Presentnes, that is, God now at this instant is zealous.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Is earnestnesse.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Is continuance as a burning.</p>
               <p>Now hee that is such a God, had need be obeyed, God commanding this, is so, therefore hee must needes bee obeyed, for that some might doubt whether God bee so or no, God himselfe prooueth, that by his zealous rustice, and zealous mercie. His iustice in that hee saith, <hi>Ʋisiting,</hi> &amp;c Wherein we must consider what he doth, and to whome: he visiteth the inqiuitie of the fathers, wherein is the obiect, the action action visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, obiect, iniquitie set out by the subiect of the father, visiting cōmeth of a latine word to visit, to visit is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to come to see, to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to iudge and do there after in which Gen. 11.5. and 18.21.</p>
               <p>Now because when God so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and findeth men faultie, hee is wont to punish, therefore is visiting
<pb facs="tcp:14909:87"/>sometimes put for punishing, as psal. 89.32. <hi>I will visit their iniquitie, with their iniquitie, with the rod, and their sinnes with scourges.</hi> And of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> if these men be visited after the visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is the punishment of all men. Numb. the 16.29.</p>
               <p>Whereupon some translate it here render ng or repaying.</p>
               <p>The obiect is iniquitie, that is sinne or breach of the law of GOD: and more especially, breach of this law, that which God neuer leaueth vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. This iniquitie set out by the subiect, in whome it is said to be, that is, fathers and aunceslors.</p>
               <p>Thus much what God doth: Now followeth to whome, vpon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or sonnes, vpon the third and fourth generation, where we may see vpon whom and how many.</p>
               <p>Hee doth thus to the sonnes and posteritie.</p>
               <p>Quest. Doe children beare the punishment of their fathers sinnes.</p>
               <p>Answer. Yea of some, as of the first sinne of our first parents, Adam
<pb facs="tcp:14909:87"/>and Eue, otherwise not. For better vnderstanding whereof, know that in sinne, wee may consider the fault against God, and the punishment, whereby God is wont to shewe his displeasure, wheresoeuer the fault is the punishment is deserued. Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are spirituall or temporall and of this life.</p>
               <p>Spirituall, hindering one from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting saluation, these God doth neuer bring vpon any but for his owne fault, and therefore originall corruption is partly our owne fault because we are part of Adam.</p>
               <p>Of this life are such as do not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der saluation, and befall the godly &amp; wicked both alike, and are to the godly many times profitable.</p>
               <p>Now indeed sometimes by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of others, the godly feele some outward smart, but still with Gods loue so as such sufferings are no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, but exercises and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and therefore God neuer puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth other mens sins in vs, but such as we haue and learne from them.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:88"/>
               <p>Now for that Idolatrie is learned by parents for the most part, therfore God sheweth, that the dutie which children owe to parents, shall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them if they learne Idolarie, and false worship of God from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Now all this while no certaine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is named, that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders might feare at, neither is time mentioned that euer punishment might be looked for.</p>
               <p>How many this punishment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth, <hi>Is vpon the third and fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of them that hate me.</hi> Where first wee must remember, that this doth not stretch a partly we saw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but to such as hate God, that is, who breake this Commandement, so that wee may see all breakers of Gods Commaundements, in some sort doe hate God, vnder what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence so euer it bee and that it reach to the third and fourth generation, that is, I take it to any that do breake the Commaundement, some named for all, thus we see how God destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:14909:88"/>the Canaauites, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1 This maner of speech is vsed to reach vs, that this kind of sinne is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conueied by parents to children.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That parents should be carefull to instruct their children in the pure worship of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That children, if they meane to bee freed from Gods punishments, should especially seeke from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to learne to worship GOD purely,</p>
               <p>So that it is much for the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, of what parents one commeth. And here wee may learne to answere to the Papists, what wee should thinke of their ancestors and ours: who died in papistrie, for wee see, that three or foure generations may hate God.</p>
               <p>Thus much for Gods zeale in his iustice: Now followeth his zeale in his mercie, <hi>Shewing mercie to, &amp;c.</hi> Where we may see what he doth, and to whome he sheweth mercie, that is, forgiueth their sinnes, bestoweth sundrie fauours of this life, and of
<pb facs="tcp:14909:89"/>that which is to come, as in Abraham Isaack, Iacob, Dauid, not for their workes, but as this word is for his mercie.</p>
               <p>Quest. How is this true seeing that many Idolaters doe flourish, and true worshippers of GOD are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
               <p>Answer. Though Idolaters scape here, they are punished hereafter and though the godly yet are here vnder the crosse, yet are they in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and shall inioy him for euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
               <p>Thus much for this second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and the maner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the true God: Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the end in the third, wherein is set downe not onely the end of the worship of God, but of all other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatsoeuer, the summe of all which is, commaunding to vse pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name of God, and forbidding the contrarie.</p>

               <p>So as the breach of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is hainous, and the more as the glorie of God is most deare to himselfe and good reason: for if sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men respect this reputatiō ought not God much more?</p>

               <p>And though no perticular punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should followe yet impunitie

<pb facs="tcp:14909:94"/>if they sanctifie the sabboths then shall the Kings and Princes enter in at the gates of the Citie of Ierusalem, and shall sit vpon the throne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid and shall ride vpon chariots and vpon horses, both they and their Princes, the men of Iuda and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Ierusalem, &amp;c. Looke the place so as that the godly haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies great account of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Of the Institution of it in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise after the creation as being bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great number of ceremonies and euen in mans innocency.</p>
               <p n="4">4 To prepare our selues for the due keeping of it so, Exod. 10.24.</p>
               <p>This preparation is:</p>
               <p n="1">1 First the dispatch of our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesse for the weeke past, the night before spending the sixe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dayes so that with ioye wee may keepe the sabboth holy.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the preparation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Commaundement it selfe followeth in the rest and this commaundement is shortly set down
<pb facs="tcp:14909:94"/>and further declared: shortly set downe, <hi>Keepe holy the Sabboth day.</hi> This as other commaundements hath the person: The dutie. The person thou as euery one, so especially gouerners, as may appeare in that our sons and daughters must so doe, a patterne whereof we haue in Nehemiah. 13.</p>
               <p>The dutie as others hath obiect, Act. Obiect is where about the Act and practise is to be, that here is. The sabboth day.</p>
               <p>Day is naturall or artificiall: Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is the space of 24. houres, equall from euening to euening: from sun to sunne. Artificiall is from the light rising to the setting: I take it that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall day is here meant, &amp; though the Iewes did count the sabboth from euening to euening: yet it was but as they counted their other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dayes, not to be vp and wake all night no more then their bodies will beare, and because bodily rest is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie &amp; allowed, therefore though the night belong to the day to make it whole naturall, and I iudge it were
<pb facs="tcp:14909:95"/>no more to be kept holy then the working day, so as that day is the light, and so much of the night as may be spared for hurting of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
               <p>This day signifieth of it selfe holy euery houre and euery minute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as the creature without hurte in it selfe, but this day is not euery daye but the sabboth. Sabboth of it selfe doth signifie rest or time of rest here, it is put for a day especially set apart for rest as the particle ha in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe, and the astixe sheweth among the Iewes were sundrie such times, as of yeares, of weekes, of dayes, all which they were to keepe: also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their daies some did not so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten returne, some did returne in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seauen dayes, which day doth manifestly appeare to be meant here, as by repeating the dayes of creation, the dayes of workes is manifest.</p>
               <p>This is the obiect, the act follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, keepe it holy sanctifie it in one word, both are one to sanctifie or hallowe doth signifie diuersly.</p>

               <p>So did the Israelites gather their Manna and prepare it before, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After these sixe, the next day ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately, is the day the Lord here meaneth, counting from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the creation: This day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reckoning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our church is that which we call Saturday, the which for all the peoples being in Egypt and the Sun standing still in Iosias time, and the going of it backe in Ahaz daye wee iudge that the Iewes did obserue.</p>
               <p>Object. But here a great question doth arise, why we and other christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an churches doe obserue the next day after, which is the eight day from the creation and not the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth.</p>
               <p>Answ. The Iewish sabboth is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into that day which we obserue, for the keeping in memory the great
<pb facs="tcp:14909:97"/>benifit of Christs resurrection which is greater to vs then our first creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now this day wee vse hath ground of scripture, 1. Cor. 26.1. Act 20.7. And is called the first day of the weeke, that is the first day after the Iewish sabboth, and in the first of the Reuel. the Lords day for that the Lord Christ rose thereon, and after appeared often in it, to his disciples after his rising.</p>
               <p>Obiect. But some may say by what authoritie was this charge, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ground standeth our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>
               <p>Answ. All learned men are not of one mind, I thinke they hold the truth, that take it to bee Christ, on changing by expresse appointment or inspiring his Apostles so to do for himselfe, as was said rose on this day, did he appeare to Marie, Iohn. 20. on this day to Tho. mas 8 daies after hee had appeared to his disciples: which likewise Ciril saith must needs be the Lords daies. For this cause saith Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. Gen. 17.12. was circumcision
<pb facs="tcp:14909:97"/>counted the eight day, as a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the right day. When Christ rose from the dead for the counsel of Phoro Iuliense saith, that Esay. 58.13. Prophesied of this day, sure it is, that presently it was kept by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: who durst not, if they had not had sufficient warrant so sodenly haue left the vsuall day.</p>
               <p>Athanasius plainly saith, that Christ himselfe changed the day, certaine it is that vnlesse greater authoritie then that which changed it, &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cause then that for which it was changed come, it may not be altered from that it is.</p>
               <p>This Sabboth is said to be of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah</hi> thy God that is ordained by him to be kept vnto him.</p>
               <p>Thus haue we the Sabboth day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded what it is: now followeth the exposition of sanctification, <hi>In it thoushalt do no maner of worke, thou nor thysonne, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein is shewed what is forbidden and whome: and worke forbidden.</p>
               <p>Worke is that which was called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:14909:98"/>thy worke: to wit, of a perticular calling, except the calling be for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of godlines, as of a preacher: or the duties be of charitie and kindnes to man or beast, or other creatures: and can neither be well done afore or after.</p>
               <p>Now therefore if worke be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, much more rest, playing, and singing: there are forbidden a mans owne selfe or any other by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or suffering: ones wife is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med because she is presumed to bee himselfe, that whatsoeuer is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him, must be knowne to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden her: Sonne or daughter: knowe to whome we carrie most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection and so might winke at them: manseruant or maidseruant: whome thou mightest haue vse for to set about thy busines: beast, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the labouring beast, as Oxe, Asse, Horse.</p>
               <p>Quest. Hath God care ouer beasts?</p>
               <p>Answ. Yea, for mans sake least man by tending the beast in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might be occasioned to breake
<pb facs="tcp:14909:98"/>&amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Sabboth whereupon we must knowe that not onely beastes, but whatsoeuer may neede mans helpe, as mill, boate, &amp;c. should stay. Some exception must be made in regard of warre, or a long voyage vpon the Sea, or riding post for the cōmon wealths great good: Sranger properly prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite one who is won to the Iewish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion others are not so to be vrged.</p>
               <p>Marke that any ouer others, are to cause all theirs to keepe holy the sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the exposition of this commaundement, the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion followeth: wherein are reasons to enforce to the obedience thereof.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 The first whereof is God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth but one of seauen, therefore good reason it is that wee should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay.</item>
                  <item>2 God srequireth noe more then that he himselfe hath done, therefore ought men so to do: God resteth from creating, not from gouerning: from making new kinds, not singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="tcp:14909:99"/>things.</item>
                  <item>3 God hath blessed and hallowed this day, to this end: therefore it must be kept. Thus haue we the cōmnande<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment shortly laid downe: but all this while here is nothing of the place.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The place of Gods worship is euery where: neuerthelesse, the publike must be in publike places, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was tied to the Arke and was flitting at this time when the law was giuen, is not mentioned, yet was it set so as whosoeuer would publikely worship God: else where, then did offend.</p>
               <p>Such places were the Tabernacle, the Temple of Ierusalen, the sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue: we haue temples, but indeed this must bee remembred none is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so to any one place as the Iewes were to Ierusalem, because the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there was a Tipe of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whome nothing could please</p>
               <p>And yet againe worshippe as it is in time so must it bee in place of publike pure and sounde worshippe of God, publike places
<pb facs="tcp:14909:99"/>must be resorted vnto, neither must men tarrie at home or haunt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>Quest. But put case, some notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sinners resort thither, ought not I then to forbeare.</p>
               <p>Answer. No, other mens sinnes if I consent not to them, shall not hurt mee.</p>
               <p>Quest. It may further bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, whether a man bee tied to his owne parish.</p>
               <p>Answer. Indeede, parishes were distinguished by men: neuerthelesse, not to bee neglected when conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, for distance of place, one may resort vnto them, and there bee in them sufficient meanes of saluation, and no other iust cause restraining. So then publike time, must haue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise publik places, and established in peaceable Churches.</p>
               <p>By all this, hitherto wee may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Gods meaning is, to haue all publike duties of his worship to bee performed in due sort.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14909:100"/>are either before it or on.</p>
               <p>Duties before it are:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To desire the Sabaoth, for the duties of the Sabaoth. Esa. 58.13.14. and therefore Amos blameth those which wish the Sabaoth gone, that they may set forth their corne.</item>
                  <item>2. Dispatch of all businesse, as much as in vs lieth, that neither the rest, nor holynesse of the Sabaoth be hindered. Exod. 16.23.29. Ioh. 19.31.</item>
                  <item>3. That the weeke dayes duties doe not drowne our minds, but that we may freely and chearefully attend the worship of God, this shall we doe vsing the world a not abusing it. 1. Cor. 7. On that day are sundrie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which before I name, this must be remembred.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. That all Iewishe superstition must be remoued, the Iewes will not roast an Aple, peele an Onion, kill a Flea, snuffe a Candle on this day, but hire others to doe it for them.</p>
               <p>Quest. It may bee demaunded, what should be thought of him who
<pb facs="tcp:14909:100"/>gathered stickes. Numb. 15.32.</p>
               <p>Answer. Though the thing seeme small, it was verie great, being done vpon contempt.</p>
               <p>Quest. But what of making fire?</p>
               <p>Answer. That none which hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the sanctification of this day, should be made.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We must not iudge this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement as ceremoniall, being before the fall. Gen. 2.</p>

Rom. 13.8. <hi>Thou shalt not commit adulterie,</hi> and if there bee any other Commaundement, it is briefely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this saying, euen in this, <hi>Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this short summe, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the person, and the thing: The person, is our neighbour.</p>
               <p>Neighbour, is he or she, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the same Adam and Eue, or who pertaketh a reasonable soule, he is called. Esa. 58.7. Our flesh, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scriptures our brother: so said Moses to them that stroue, you are brethren. And Salomon wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that if he that hate vs be hungrie we should giue him bread to eate, yea so kind should we bee to them, that we should pray for them. Act. 7.60.</p>
               <p>Then we must especially shew this loue when they neede. Luk. 10.30. 2.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:103"/>King. 6.22.3. For then are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede owners of the thing, such is the Hebrew phrase.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, some difference is to be kept, we must be good to all, but chiefely to the houshold of faith. Gal. 6.10. Such as are without, we ought to endeuour al we can to bring them to Christ, these of the houshold of faith must wee loue, and make to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, we must liue peaceably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all men, more familiarly, with the godly.</p>
               <p>This for the person: the thing is in the dutie, and the measure.</p>
               <p>The dutie is loue: Loue is to wish one well for the parties owne sake, it is taken sometimes for the bare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, sometimes for the workes thereof, sometimes for both, here it is taken for both. In the affection of loue are.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Iudging well of the partie.</item>
                  <item>2. Thinking often of him.</item>
                  <item>3. Indeuouring to gratifie and pleasure him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The effects are infinite, looke. 1.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:104"/>Cor. 1.13. thoroughout, whereupon it followeth, that the dutie is so great as neuer can fully bee performed. So as likewise all other must be done in it, the measure is as thy selfe, we must remember loue is ordinate or inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate. Inordinate, is which neither hath iust cause to moue it, nor due measure in it. Ordinate hath both, this onely is vnderstood, so as louing our selues well, we must loue others so likewise.</p>
               <p>Hitherto the summe of the second table, which Christ commandeth in that he saith, it is like to the other.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Hard to be kept.</item>
                  <item>2. Necessarie.</item>
                  <item>3. Profitable.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Whereupon the former, the lawe and the Prophets doe depend, that is, are chiefely spent in setting downe the dutie contained therein.</p>
               <p>The Commandements themselues of the second table follow, requiring duties of all sorts of men, and these are of practise: The other signifieth, those which are with consent, and
<pb facs="tcp:14909:104"/>these are verses. 12.13.14.15.16.</p>
               <p>Whereof as the persons towards whome they are practised are diuers, so are the kinds.</p>
               <p>The persons; are superious and betters, and others.</p>
               <p>Duties in respect of betters; are commaunded, verse 12. before the rest, to shew that publike must bee preferred before priuate.</p>
               <p>The Commaundement requiring these duties, is the first with promise. Eph. 6.2. shewing some speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that ought to be had thereof.</p>
               <p>Obiect. One may doubt how this should be true; since al Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments if they bee kept, haue promise of life: And againe, seeing the second Commaundement likewise hath a promise of mercie, to thousands. &amp;c. But we are to answere.</p>
               <p>Answer. That Paule in calling it the first, hee meaneth the first of the second table, and the first which hath his particular promise. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manndementes all and so the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, haue a generall and indefinite
<pb facs="tcp:14909:105"/>promise. This commandement char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to honour Parents and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the contrarie. It hath two parts, the dutie and the promise.</p>
               <p>The dutie is <hi>Honour thy Father and mother.</hi> The dutie in the rest: the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie setteth out the parties and the thing. The parties honouring, to be honoured.</p>
               <p>The partie honouring or who is to honor. Thou that is euery one, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Noble, as well as others, great men as well as others.</p>
               <p>So did Solomon honour his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther though he were a king, so did Ioseph his parents hee beeing a great Prince: this must bee thought of for all practises of honour.</p>
               <p>The parties to be honoured, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother:</hi> Who signifie all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours whatsoeuer, whome God thus calleth, to teach all superiours to be affected to their inferiors, as parents to children in which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Romanes called their chiefe men fathers, and with all to teach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, in what kindnesse they are
<pb facs="tcp:14909:105"/>to performe dutie, to wit, as children to their parents.</p>
               <p>Obiect. But Christ forbiddeth Mat. 22.9. to call any man father.</p>
               <p>Ans. Christs speech must be taken in his owne meaning, hee meaneth here father in that sense, it was vsed amongst the Pharises, and such as would bee counted learned, so else where doth Christ speake fitting himselfe to the conceipts of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, as Iohn. 5.31. if I should beare witnesse of my selfe my witnesse were true: that is if I were, as you, suppose me to be; so likewise Iohn. 7.16. my doctrine is not mine, that is, as you take me to be a meere man, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After the same sorte forbiddeth he to call Father. The Iewes and the Pharises vsed this as a swelling title, being desirous to be called in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Ahothemi, that is, our fathers: as the holy father the Pope, so the Romish Priestes are called fathers. They are not content wirh the olde name of Friers and brothers, in this sense onely doth Christ forbid.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:106"/>
               <p>Father is he who begetteth: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shee who beareth: these are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <p>Now by these as before was sayde are all superiors meant: So as father and mother may be considered: by nature who naturally beget or beare, among whome are Grandfather and Grandmother and so vpward to great Grandfather if they liue: or by office onely when as the place one is in, requireth the dutie of a Father &amp;c Mother: to which in some sorte bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long affinitie of Father or Mother by mariage, gardians and such like as they bring vp who was Mordecai to Hester.</p>
               <p>This office is spirituall or bodily: spirituall, in a dutie which especially concerneth the spirit, or soule and the life to come: whereby one is a pastour to beget, or mother to beare to God, and heauen. Bodily dutie, which is for the most in thinges of this life, and endeth with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and this is publike or priuate.</p>
               <p>Publike is that which is for all of
<pb facs="tcp:14909:106"/>that place, as is the Magistrate or Schoolemaister.</p>
               <p>The Magistrate is he who maketh and executeth lawes, and hath parte of gouernment and beareth authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>The Magistrate is soueraigne, or vnder soueraigne, as the monarke, Emperour, King, Queene, &amp;c. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such as are by the authoritie of the soueraigne of any sorte.</p>
               <p>The Schoolemaster who bringeth vp in learning and nurture: By pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate office, and this in the house, or out of the house: In the house, the husband in respect of the wife is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereupon amongst the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Romanes the new maried wife who became good-wife of the house, was to her husband as a daughter: so noteth Budeus vpō the Pandects, the nurce to the nurce-child: so noteth Hotoman vpō the Institutes, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or mistresse ouer the seruant.</p>

               <p>Those excell in blood, whose An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetors for good deserts haue beene aduanced: and these must knowe that the image of God is the best coate armour to beare: so as if their Ancest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors vertues be not in them as well as their bloud, they are maimed.</p>
               <p>Thus much what these parents are, who must bee honoured, among whom for that the mother who hath infirmities is named: it sheweth that euery of these former though they haue their faults, must not want their honours.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the thing to bee performed, which is honour. This must be with limitation as it is, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians
<pb facs="tcp:14909:111"/>6.1. in the Lord that is according to the will of God, otherwise wee must iudge as Acts. 5.29. That it is better to obay God then men. when their commandements are contrary. So did the three men. Dan. 3. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse howsoeuer wee doe not the wicked commandement of parents, yet we must suffer such punishments as lawfull gouernours by humane lawes do inflict vpon vs, we must not resist no more then these did. Dan. 3.</p>
               <p>Obiect. But what if the thing bee indifferent which is here commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Ans. Before I do it, first I must out of the word of God be perswaded of the lawfulnesse of it, and, not doing doubtingly then is it a sinne, I must take heede of giuing scandall.</p>
               <p>Obiect. But what if searching out the nature of the thing commanded I cannot find out in perticular as my prince commanding me to assist the distressed King of Portugall: I see no further into it.</p>
               <p>Ans. I thinke, I not onely may, but
<pb facs="tcp:14909:112"/>should be perswated of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it in this case, I take it rather the commaunders fault if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, then obeyers.</p>
               <p>The kind of the thing here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is <hi>Honour:</hi> shewing all manner of due respect euerie way in the hiest degree. Honour contayneth all other duties in it, and is (if wee shoulde speake as it is) prayse much increased, inlarged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by all other tokens. In this place according to the sundrie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to whome it belongeth, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to all and euerie, it is as much as is due, we may consider of it as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Specially generall: we may call it which belongeth to all parents. And this is manifold.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To iudge that they ought to be honoured, for that excellencie which God hath put vpon them. Rom. 1.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To iudge them better then our selues in that behalfe. Philip, 2.3. Rom. 12.10.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:14909:112"/>
               <p n="4">4 Commendable shamefastnesse in their presence. Iob. 29.20, 21, 22, which ariseth from the conscience of our owne vnworthinesse, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of those which are our betters.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Care in all things to hide their infirmities. Gen. 9.22, 23, 24. We see how that displeased God: Infirmities should neuer make vs shew lesse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor procure vs to tell them to others.</p>

               <p>Ans. It is meant of flattering and

               <p>Proper honour remaineth to some one kind, and first, to the naturall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents belongeth the cōmon &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular honor, in greater measure, so as not onely he that striketh his father. Exod. 21.15. but also he who curseth his father. Exo. 21.17. Looke Psal. 30.17. The mother bare, the father &amp; she brought vp, beare their infirmities, relieue their wants more thē others. To the spirituall father. Thes. 1.5.13. To haue them in singular loue for their workes sake, yea Gal. 4.15. To plucke out their owne eyes. 1. Tim. 5.17, Double honour, which Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
<pb facs="tcp:14909:114"/>vnderstandeth for reuerence, &amp; things necessarie for this life, I think we should not be curious about the number. Double signifieth much and great honour, so the spirit doubled, or a double portion, 2. King. 2.9. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth verie much, as the first borne was to haue a double portion.</p>
               <p>All this honour is that the pastor may with more authoritie preach the word, and that the people with more fruite might heare it.</p>
               <p>The first is that the spirituall father might be without feare. 1. Cor. 16.10 which is to be deliuered from vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and captious men.</p>
               <p>The second that he who is taught in the word, make him who taught him: pertaker of all his goods. Gal. 6.6. Thus were the Leuites prouided for.</p>

               <p>In the generall, honour which was spoken of before, for indeede, the wife is the glorie of the man. 1. Cor. 11.7. That is, she ought to do to her husbands glorie, rather then her owne: and that in her attire and such things which while they are costlier and gayer then her husbandes, is to his dishonour: if it be with neglect of his commaundement to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with impayring his estate, lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his authoritie ouer her.</p>

               <p>Ans. The honour is commaunded by God and therefore none may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease it but God.</p>
               <p>Quest. What if one be a child one way, and a father another way.</p>
               <p>Ans. Hee must giue and take ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour accordingly.</p>

               <p>Ans. No longer then he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in such a kind of father.</p>
               <p>Thus farre hath beene the dutie: the promise followeth, the which is not read alike by al interpreters. The worde which is translated, <hi>That thy dayes may bee prolonged,</hi> may bee taken passiuely or actiuely. Passiuely, as some other wordes, Iob. 4.19. Luke. 16.19. In which sense some take it here: Actiuely, <hi>That they may prolong,</hi> In such sense speaketh Paule. 1. Tim. 4.16. Iam. 5.20. Act. 26.18. Thus it seemeth to be taken here, as it is else where, and as some learned men thinke: wherefore let vs read, <hi>That they may prolong thy dayes, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein let vs consider the kinde of the gift, the meanes of it. The kind of the gift, is <hi>Prolonging, &amp;c.</hi> The meanes are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. In the kinde is the meaning, to the gift and setting it out, it is named <hi>prolonging of dayes,</hi> set out, <hi>by the lande which the Lord giueth.</hi> The chiefe thing is <hi>dayes,</hi> set out by <hi>prolonging.</hi> Dayes by an vsuall manner of speach in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:14909:116"/>signifie time, because a day was the first sensible distinction of time.</p>
               <p>Now though nothing else bee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, something else must bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode: for onely to haue dayes may be no great fauour, as in all of them to be in death, he meaneth therefore dayes of life naturall, ciuill, not onely so: for though a man had neuer so many dayes, yet liue in sicknes, want, disgrace, his increased dayes should increase his wo. He meaneth dayes of life, flourishing in good health, and outward fauours of God, as Esay. 65, 20.21. For in deede life is not to liue, but to be in good, health.</p>
               <p>Prolonging is not a length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aboue the appointed time, but granting from the first a long time of life: so that now this prolonging of dayes is the flourishing condition of any state, family or person, wherein is quietnesse or peace, 1. Timo. 2.2. wealth. Rom. 13.4. Somewhat may appeare by the contrarie. Esay. 3.4.5.13. and Prou. 30.17.</p>
               <p>It must be remembred, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb facs="tcp:14909:117"/>is not made for the desert of the former dutie performed, but vppon Gods owne meere mercie, to shew how acceptable the dutie is.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We are not to iudge alwayes of the fauour of God to saluation by this benefite, for sometimes it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon the wicked: nor on the contrarie to thinke, that where it is not, that therefore there is Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure to damnation. But then wee may iudge that we are in good estate with it, if in it we profite in all sauing graces, if we vse long life to approch the nearer to heauen, and likewise vse it to the good of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This gift is not general and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, but as God seeth it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for vs: wherefore if the question be asked, why God doth not alwayes giue to the godly long life: here it may be answered: it is because God dooth see that it is not the best for them.</p>
               <p>Againe, this promise is more for a state in generall, of kingdome, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, or corporation, where this dutie
<pb facs="tcp:14909:117"/>is performed, that it shall flourish, then that euery speciall person shall haue long life.</p>
               <p>Besides, if God while he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth long life, giue euerlasting life, he breaketh not his promise. Hitherto the gift named the setting out of it.</p>
               <p>Further, it followeth, <hi>Vpon the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee.</hi> Where mention is made of a land, and the giuer thereof. This land no doubt was the land of Canaan, which God promised to his people when they came out of Egypt vnder Moses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, wherein they after continued, til they were caried captiue elswhere: yet so as that it is true of any land where God setteth his people, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Citie, towne or house. Now this land is aboue others mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was a Sacrament of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly land, so as that,

                  <item>1 These are the wordes of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant so as Gods couenant to vs, is the ground of all his fauours to vs, in the which if we be not, we cannot looke for any thing wherein we may haue comfort.</item>
                  <item>2 We haue nothing of our selues, it is Gods gift.</item>
                  <item>3 Anything that we haue, we must thanke him for, when we haue it, and seeke it of him when we want it.</item>
                  <item>4 If God giue earth, much more giueth hee heauen, and euerlasting life. Thus for the kind of the gift: the meanes follow, they, that is thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, as sayth the wise man, Ecclesiasticus, 3, 10.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now parents are said thus to doe, as Timotheus said, to saue himselfe and those that heare him. 1. Tim. 4.26. while hee is the meanes of their saluation: so parents are said to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their children, where they are meanes thereof, and indeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in such things as may procure
<pb facs="tcp:14909:118"/>the same. This they do in discharging their duties euery way, as before hath beene set downe: And here the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blessing is to bee thought of, which, no doubt, is much to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected. We must put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the blessings of the Patriarks Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, and such others, vpon their children, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the blessings of other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon men. The Patriarkes and such parties, were propheticall, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did foretell what should be by diuine inspiration, other mens bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings are but in wish and desire by praying.</p>
               <p>And this blessing of parents is an earnest desire of a parent, that things may befall the children according to the will of God.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Which in God may bee looked for, when parents haue done their duties toward their children.</item>
                  <item>2 Children haue obeyed their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in euil, may be feared, when pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents haue done their duties, and children will not obey. But neuer if
<pb facs="tcp:14909:119"/>parents wish euill, when their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do well: parents are therefore to blame, which inioyne euill things to their children vpon their blessing, as they say, for that curst counsels shall be fruitlesse, so are those that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to cursing: Hitherto duties of and to superiors: now follow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements which require duties towards others.</item>
               </list>
               <p>These duties are to be practised as well towarde our selues as others. These duties and commaundements according to the number of chiefest things among men, are foure: The first chiefe thing is life: the second chastitie: the third goods: the fourth truth, and good name: for euerie of these are seuerall commaundements. And for the first, <hi>Thou shalt not kill.</hi> Which is to commaund preseruation of life, and to forbid the contrarie; wherin we may consider the persons, and the thing: the persons, who, and whom. The person who is not to kill, <hi>thou,</hi> that is man, what colour and pretence soeuer thou haue: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:14909:119"/>who is not to be killed, thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour: the person who is not to kill, is to be vnderstood without a lawfull calling thereto, and such a one is who is not a Iudge a souldiour and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, yet neuerthelesse, these must remember that they doe it according as their calling requires, and that for good and the common good. Wee may see that the Anabaptists erre, who thinke it not lawfull to bee a Prince, or a warriour. And this which is forbidden to all, must so be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode, as that

               <p>The person who is not to bee kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (is as before) neither our selfe, nor our neighbour. The thing is not to kill. Kill, is to take away life, and yet not simply: to take away life is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. But the life of a reasonable creature, otherwise a man, may kill
<pb facs="tcp:14909:120"/>the beast for necessarie vse. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naches therefore erre, who thinke it not lawfull to kill any thing, no not to cut the hearbes: life is whereby any thing liueth: life is spirituall, ciuill, naturall. Spirituall life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the speciall worke of the holie Ghost a reasonable creature, liueth to the pleasing of God. Paule saith, A widow while she liueth in pleasure is dead: dead, that is in spirit.</p>
               <p>The soule saith Augustine, without Gods speciall working is deade, that is spiritually: and the soule of thy soule, is faith.</p>
               <p>This kind of life one taketh away by denying the meanes, as parents of what sorte soeuer with-houlding the word of God from them by giuing of scandall.</p>
               <p>Scandall is occasion of sinne, in which respect Paul biddeth to take heed, that our weake brother perish. 1. Cor. 8.11. And Christ threatneth woe to him, by whom offences come, Luk. 17 1.2. Looke Roman. 14. This life we must procure all that wee can.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:120"/>Iohn. 1.5.16. So were the Apostles commaunded, Act. 5.10. For this cause would not the Apostles depart from Christ, Iohn 6.68. Ciuill life is that estate that which one hath in ciuill societie: as of honour, office, reputation, this must bee mayntai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Naturall life, is that which is the ioyning of soule and bodie together. Naturall life hath three degrees.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Cheerefulnes of heart. In this respect God blameth the false Prophets, who made the heart of the righteous sad, Eze. 13.22. For indeed a sorrowfull heart drieth the bones. Prouerb. 17.22. Thus did Nabal first beginne to die. 1. Sam. 25.37. And thus was Rebecca wearied of her life, Gen. 27.46. for her greefe of hart at Esaues taking of wiues.</item>
                  <item>2 Soundnes of bodie when euery member is maintayned, none hurte: none taken away, so as if any bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred it is against life: for life is of all parts. These therefore that cut off a member offend against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14909:121"/>
                  <item>3 The last is health, when euerie member and power doth his worke: hence it is said, that life is to bee in good health, &amp; not only to liue. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Ionathan note his fathers fault, who made the people weake &amp; faint, 1. Sa. 14.30.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Therefore it is said Iohn. 4.50. thy sonne liueth, for he is in good health. So saith Paul, now we are aliue, that is are haile and well: if yee continue stead fast, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Wherefore all such as procure sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet and drunkennesse breake this commaundement. But what neede we goe farre for opening this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, our Sauiour Christ hath done that most excellently, Math. 5.22. &amp;c. and that by shewing the true meaning for the breach thereof in three degrees: in euery of these three degrees he setteth downe the fault and the grieuousnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The first degree is, whosoeuer is angrie with his brother vnaduisedly
<pb facs="tcp:14909:121"/>shall be culpable of iudgement. The fault is to be angrie with his brother vnaduisedly, this is murther in hart.</p>
               <p>Brother is as before. To be angry, is to be displeased with desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In vaine it is, when it is without iust cause or occasion, as Kaine was angry with Abel, Ahab with Naboth, Saul with Dauid.</p>
               <p n="2">2 When it is long, Eph. 4.26. For the Sonne should not go downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our wrath.</p>
               <p n="3">3 When it doth vnseemly appear in countenance, in gesture, in deed, or word: So as that chiefest meaning is, that wee should be moderate in our anger: So saith Iames wee should be slow to anger: and Paul be angrie but sinne not.</p>
               <p>In this behalfe is Moyses much commended, Numb. 12.13. And here we are to take heede that neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doe vainely arise, &amp; that though it do iustly arise, it do not rage: and both these are from others, or from our selues towardes others.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:122"/>
               <p>And first that it do not arise in vs by others vainely, it shall e good for vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Alwaies before hand to consider our corrupt nature, how easily it is prouoked to inkindle by anger, as gunpouder and flaxe by fire: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they who haue such commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities knowing their qualitie by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse preserue them long from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, so may wee our natures, that they be not consumed by anger, if we will watch ouer them.</p>
               <p>Besides in this behalfe some mens complexions giue them occasion more to looke vnto themselues.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Neuer to thinke our selues wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of great matters, but to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in hart our wretchednes, so shal we the better when things fall crosse without anger beare them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To acknowledge that nothing befalleth vs without Gods will wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we must learne in all meekenes to yeeled.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Not to be suspicious, one small suspicion, that we are neglected, will
<pb facs="tcp:14909:122"/>raise great anger.</p>
               <p n="5">5 By practising with our selues often to resist our owne desires, wee shal more easily beare it from others.</p>
               <p n="6">6 To auoyde occasions.</p>
               <p n="7">7 To marke the behauiour of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry men, that seeing how vnseemely it is we may bethinke to take heede of it in our selues. And that we cause not anger to arise in others wee must be carefull. Alwayes prouided, that if they be angrie at vs for good duties necessarie to be done, wee are not to bee discouraged: else should Christ and other of his seruantes haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne their duties for other folkes anger, but to be free from iust occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Neuer meddle with any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vertue of thy calling. Anger most commonly ariseth when men are out of their callings, idle, vnprofitable, busie bodies in other mens matters.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Deserue well of all; they shall be more then beastly, that then will be angrie.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Marke mens dispositions, such
<pb facs="tcp:14909:123"/>as are giuen to anger, take heede of prouoking.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Alwayes giue as good speech as possible may be.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Bee not hastie to tell reports, and when you report make the best of it, so farre as you may with good conscience.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Though you bee much prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, sometimes holde your peace. Iere. 28.11.</p>
               <p n="7">7 You must sometimes forbeare your right, if anger arise in your selues.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Let it not continue too long: it continueth too long when it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, or lesseneth any dutie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse or loue.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Doe nothing while that stirreth in you. A theredorus wished Augustus when he was angrie, to repeate the letters of the Alphabet before he did any thing, thinking that in the meane while anger would allay. The same practised Theodosius Architus saying he would haue corrected his seruant but that himselfe was angrie. Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke
<pb facs="tcp:14909:123"/>the Duke of Saxonie when hee was angrie, would shut himselfe vp in his closet, and let none come at him, till he had mastred his anger.</p>
               <p>If it arise in others by our meanes, wee must follow Christes counsaile. Mat. 5.23.24.25.</p>
               <p>God himselfe was carefull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to pacifie, Ionas. 4. the same must we do here, though we giue no iust cause, though the grieued partie be inferior to vs, though we be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fooles for our labour, yea so farre ought we our selues to bee from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that though all things were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from vs, wee should not for our owne sakes be angrie: a triall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Luther saith is, if we can wish to be wronged and iniured. Nay one saith, then shall wee bee safe and free from anger, when whatsoeuer euill befall vs, we can thinke we are not worthy so good an estate.</p>
               <p>Now indeed well doth our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ forbid anger, for of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hatred, enuie, backbiting, and such like, so that vnlesse the doore of
<pb facs="tcp:14909:124"/>anger be shut, the others as in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen floodgate came rushing in.</p>
               <p>This anger is so forbidden, as that the contrarie thereto is cōmaunded.</p>
               <p>Contrarie to anger is that which we call liking, whereby without pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or stirring, we rest well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and apaide, with our brother or sister.</p>
               <p>This is the fualt: the grieuousnes of it followeth in the desert of it, which is to bee culpable of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is a great fault deseruing punishment: which our Sauiour set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth our by the manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the ciuill Court among the Iewes, they had diuerse; the smallest was wherein the Triumuiri or three in commission sate, who ended smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler matters, and set punishments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>Now as these Iudges did punish malefactors, though with gentle pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: so this fault of being angry vnaduisedly, though it seeme small, shall not bee vnpunished, as in those Courts.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:124"/>
               <p>This place therefore, and the like following of this kind, make nothing to proue veniall sinnes, all shall bee punished according to their desert. Now the wages of sinne is death.</p>
               <p>And that vnaduised anger is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, it may appeare in Moyses, who though hee were otherwise meeke: grew when he smote the rocketwise, impatient, and forwarde, as some thinke it, to haue beene the chiefe cause why God was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with him, that hee would not let him enter into the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</p>
               <p>The second degree followeth: Whosoeuer saith to his brother Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, shall be worthy to be punished by the counsell, where is the fualt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise and the grieuousnes thereof.</p>
               <p>The fault is saying Rhaca to a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: brother, as before neighbour: Rhaca all do not interpret alike. It seemeth to be a broken speech of an angrie mind, breaking out and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying it selfe somwhat though not fully, in token of mislike: whereof
<pb facs="tcp:14909:125"/>there are diuers in euery language, as tush, fie, &amp;c. some thinke it to be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graciue speech, much like when wee speak thou to one in scorn &amp; contēpt some thinke that it commeth of the worde Rach in Hebrew, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to spit, as if saying Rhaca did signifie that the partie to whome it were said, deserued to be spit vpon, or as that in contempt of him wee would not forbear spitting in his pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>snece, sure it is a note of mislike, and may come of the word Ric: Which signifieth emptie or light head, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we care not to vse some vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gesture in witnesse of mislike, Mat. 12.14. If her father had spit on her face, that is vsed some disgrace vnto her, as this spitting was wont to bee one, Deu. 25.9.</p>
               <p>Rhaca thē is the bewraying of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie &amp; festring soare by some vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speech or behauiour, and may be:
<list>
                     <item>1 In countenance.</item>
                     <item>2 In mouth, as in mowes, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>3 In worde, tush, fie, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>4 In making a loude and vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:14909:125"/>noyce, Eph. 4.31.</item>
                     <item>5 In scoffing, Gal. 4 29.</item>
                     <item>6 In bitternes, Eph. 4.31.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now here as before liking was cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, so open loue contrarie to Rhaca is inioyned, so as that wee should declare it by all the meanes we can: as iesture, voyce, and sound; and such like.</p>
               <p>This is the faulte: the punishment and greeuousnes followeth: shall bee worthie to be punished by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: Here as before our Sauiour ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a comparison from the Iewish courtes, for as beefore hee expressed the punishment due to the former fault, comparing it with a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the lower court: So doth he here. Aboue the former court was one wherein 23. Iudges were in cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, these dealt in greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; inflicted greater punishments: so should they who offend in this kind of saying Rhace, haue greater punishment then the former.</p>
               <p>The third and last degree follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Whosoeuer saith foole shall bee
<pb facs="tcp:14909:126"/>worthy to be punished with hell fire.</p>
               <p>The fault is to call fool, this tearme is put for all vnseemely manifest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior, bewraying a rankling &amp; feste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mind with anger &amp; hatred: so as this word is not onely meant, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the like, or worse meaning, or lesse: blocke, dolt, knaue, &amp;c. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee disgrace the partie made to the Image of God.</p>
               <p>And seeing that vile words are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, it necessarily followeth that blowes and such like must bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne.</p>
               <p>Quest. But it may be demaunded, may not gouernours vse such spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches sometimes?</p>
               <p>Ans. The seldomer the better, and though that Christ himselfe did so, yet it is hard for vs to do as hee did: hee had the spirit without measure, and could not sinne. Indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gouernours may.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 Sharply rebuke faultes rather then men.</item>
                  <item>2 And men onely in hatred of faults.</item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14909:126"/>
                  <item>3 With loue which desireth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the offender.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If they be angrie vnaduisedly or discourage their inferiour they sinne.</p>
               <p>Here then all manifest signes in speech and deede, bewraying anger and hatred are condemned: which beeing many, I forbeare to reckon them vp.</p>
               <p>Now as all these practises are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, then contrarie is required in all that wee can, most manifestly to witnesse our loue.</p>
               <p>The punishment of this fault re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth. Shall be worthie to bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with hell fire, the most hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in these words heel fire: the word Gehenna commeth of two Hebrew words. Ge: which is vallie of dale, of Himnon, as dushendale, &amp;c. So it is called, Iosuah. 15.8. In this place had the Iewes Topheth to burne their Sons and daughters in the fire, as Ier. 7.31. Now by reason of the great fire which was vsually there: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Gehenna is put for the place &amp; torments of the damned, and Mat. 5.29.30.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:127"/>and 10.28. and 23.15. The doubt may be how it should be taken here, some thinke in the latter sense, true it is that this sinne of calling foole, deserueth hell: but yet I take it as in the former. So here our Sauiour had respect vnto the Iewes, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sids the former courts &amp; punishmēts, had a place where grieuous faultes were punished, by strangling, behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, stoning, burning: and because burning seemed to be most terrible, and was vsed in the vallie of Hinnon: therefore our Sauiour sheweth that he who saith foole, deserueth a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter punishment then the former: in as much as the punishmēt in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of Hinnon by fire is more terrible then other punishments.</p>
               <p>All sinnes are deadly in themselues, yet one is greater then other, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth greater punishment: by this exposition of our Sauior Iesus Christ, we may see that as the murther of the heart and mouth, so necessarily must the murther of the hand and deed be condemned: which is not only in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:14909:127"/>away life, but in giuing any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of taking it away.</p>
               <p>A man taketh away life frō himselfe or from other: one may not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his owne life. The commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is generall, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> for he that killeth himselfe offereth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Gods Image, which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue this law doth specially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. We read not that Iob or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, or any in neuer so miserable outward estate, so did: and indeede so to do, proceedeth from vnbeleefe, by occasion whereof the wicked haue laid handes on themselues: as Saul, Achitophel, Iudas, and such like: nay, Lucretia so renowned amongst the heathen men was to blame.</p>
               <p>Obiect. But it may be saide, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zias in the booke of Machabees is commended for killing himselfe.</p>
               <p>Ans. That booke is not part of the pure canonicall scripture, properly so called: and there is the partie ciuilly commended rather then Godly.</p>
               <p>Quest. What may we say of such as in warres haue put themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:14909:128"/>such daungers, out of the which they had neuer hope to returne: of this sorte are they who runne vppon the pikes the forlorne hope, do these kill themselues.</p>
               <p>Ans. No warre is grounded on the word and warrant of God, so as that all duties thereof are of ones cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, beesides howsoeuer thinges seeme dangerous and desperate, yet manie in the middest of all them escape.</p>
               <p>Neither may a man take away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans life, by Italion deuises, by force or any way else: yea, we must take heede of occasions thereunto, whereupon to shewe how farre his people should be from this, he would not haue them so much as to eat with bloud, to take the damme and yonge bird together, to kill the damme and yonge in one day, to seeth a kid in the dammes milke. Here all oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the poore is forbidden. Esai. 3 15. Pitie is to be shewed to the beasts Pro. 12.12. Forbidden in this kind is combate when the Iudge will haue a
<pb facs="tcp:14909:128"/>matter tried out by the sworde, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two or three, this hath:</p>
               <p n="1">1 No warrant out of scriptures.</p>
               <p>Quest. It may be said, this did Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid and Goliah trie it out. Ans. That this was extraordinarie.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It was in warre when some fewe may be hazarded that therby the rest may be the safer.</p>
               <p>Though it seeme to meane to trie out truth, yet because of the innocēt, we must not tempt God, nor do euill that good may come of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is seldom without anger and vainglorie.</p>
               <p>The like may bee said of making a fray, which is not by law, nor so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate as the former: it is altogither vnlawfull, being from anger in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, killeth all charitie whatsoeuer it doth else, ouerthroweth patience, which is none: if for euerie concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued wrong we must go into the field.</p>
               <p>Obiect. But one will say hee hath done me great wrong.</p>
               <p>Answ. Beare, or let the lawes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge for thee, not thine own armes.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:129"/>Wherefore such frayes as these, must not be appointed, and if they be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, they must not be kept. It is a great fault to make them, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to keepe them.</p>
               <p>We must not forget to speake the same of giuing the stab, for giuing a lie: this is murther what colour of valour &amp; souldier like worth it hath. Here may a man abuse the Art of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, Bear-bayting, and Bul-bayting is very daungerous.</p>
               <p>This is the commaundement for preseruation of life.</p>

And this is the greater, for that God hath allowed a generall remedy for all sorts, viz. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, so as the offēders haue nothing to excuse themselues by. Besides, he that faileth herein, sinneth against his owne bodie, 1. Cor. 6.15. making his bodie an instrument and obiect, otherwise then it is in euerie other sinne.</p>
               <p>Quest. Why doe our gouernours set a greater punishment vpon theft then adulterie?</p>
               <p>Ans, They thinke that theft hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth societie more then adulterie.</p>
               <p>In this Commaundement, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we may consider the person of the thing, the person <hi>thou,</hi> as before none whosoeuer, Courtier, or any
<pb facs="tcp:14909:130"/>that thinke it a token of loue, &amp;c. none must offend.</p>
               <p>The thing forbidden is <hi>Adulterie: Adulterie</hi> properly is betweene two persons, whereof one at the least is maried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adulterie</hi> is here put for other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanesse, the worde in Hebrew may signifie whordome, and may be read thus, <hi>Commit no whordome,</hi> whereby chastitie is commaunded. Chastitie is abstinence from all strange and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lusts about the desire of sexe. Strange lusts are those which are not according to nature, and which are not in &amp; towards our maried cōpani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, husband, or wife. Or it is the pure and honest act of the power which God hath giuen to beget with, not onely for deed, but for thought and desire: so teacheth Christ. Mat. 5.28. Which is likewise to be vnderstoode of a woman, so, which if she doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise desire to that ende, she doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, if it be beside her own husband, or owne wife. So as that a man may be free from touch, &amp; yet not chast.
<pb facs="tcp:14909:130"/>Peter sayth, there bee eyes full of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie. 2. Pet. 2.14. Or it is the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of ones vessell in holinesse and honour. Thes. 4.4. Possession is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall so keeping, as Luke. 21.19. By your patience possesse your souls. Be constant in patience, so as that if one faile but once, he loseth the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of continuance.</p>
               <p>This continuance is to be thought of for the returning of desires: for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are at one time more stirred, and stronger then at an other. He that can forbeare in all stirring, he possesseth: and he yeeld not but resist the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Vessell, all doe not vnderstand alike: some take it for the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and euerie part, not much amisse, for in deed the whole bodie must be chast. It was well said by one, it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not in what part one be vncleane if hee bee vncleane: wherefore eies, hands, &amp;c. must be ordered.</p>
               <p>We might stretch it, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further to the soule, and so the whole person of a man, where in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie power he must be cleane. But sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb facs="tcp:14909:131"/>that which I shall say to bee iudged by other, I take it, by vessell is meant that which cannot honestly be named, and putteth difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene man and woman, in which sense the place. 1. Sam. 21.5. is to bee taken. The vessels of the yonger men are holy, for hee had said before, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue beene separated from vs these two or three dayes. Where hee sheweth what it is to haue the yong mens vessels holy, that is, seperate from women. This place the most learned Tremelius and Iunius haue interpreted amisse, taking vessels for implements necessarie for their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: so speaketh Plautus in Penulo. I doe otherwise, then adulterers taken in the deed doing, I come home with my vesselles safe and sound, they were wont who tooke them in the deede to cut off their priuities.</p>
               <p>Vessell is the Instrument of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the Canonists speake of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall venery. <hi>Extravasa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is thus called to teach vs to speake and thinke honestly &amp; chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:14909:131"/>to forbeare all ribaldrie and filthy speech: This vessell must be possessed in holinesse: this holinesse is the pure vse of it euen in the presence of God: where neither the person is defiled, the dutie, instrument not abused by deede, worde, looke, thought, &amp;c. Besides it must be in honour, which is when we so vse our selues, as that neither in our selues, nor before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wee neede not be ashamed.</p>
               <p>Sinne in this kind causeth shame. Instruments of this sinne are likewise shame: now therfore as on our come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parts we put on more honour, 1. Cor. 12.23.24. That is, let them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shew their vnseemlinesse, but make them as handsome as wee can: so much we procure all things here.</p>
               <p>This chastitie is in single or marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life: single life, is when one liueth without the other sexe: and this is in maidens or widdowes life.</p>
               <p>Maidens or virgines life is beefore one is married: widdowes life is after mariage when the husband or wife is dead: each of these is a pure forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:14909:132"/>of the act and motion or stirring to begetting.</p>
               <p>Pure forbearing, is that which is free from all pollutions, looke, Eph. 5.12. so as that wee must haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent eyes and lookes.</p>
               <p>This chastitie in single life is not nor neuer can be without a speciall gift: so saith Christ, Math. 19.11.12. &amp; Paul. 1. Cor. 7.37. so as that without this gift all vowes whatsoeuer are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible in law, &amp; vord at their instant.</p>
               <p>This gift is called continencie and is a speciall gift of God, whereby one can liue without the neede of other sexe to satisfie desire.</p>

Lawfull is, which is according to Gods lawes, and the lawes of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. Gods lawes require that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age should bee in the Lord. 1. Cor. 7. That is in the Lord which is.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Parents must not be hard, nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but what God will, that ought they to will. And this marriage must be but of one man, and one woman onely: many husbands for one wife, or many wiues for one husband, are not allowable to haue. Many wiues was a sinne in the Patriarkes. Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is dissolued according to the worde of God by death, iust diuorse, malitious desertions, and then the suruiuer and innocent partie, after
<pb facs="tcp:14909:134"/>due proceeding may marrie againe, though neuer so often, so as second and third marriages are not vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>They of the Romane religion erre, in counting one to haue two wiues, who hath married againe after the first marriage dissolued, or who hath married a widow. To marriage God calleth all such as haue not the gift of continencie, so as that they may not forbeare marriage without sinne. Looke. 1. Cor. 7.9. Yea any whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue made a vow to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For no vow must bind to sinne, and a man must sinne, where he hath no gift to do otherwise.</p>
               <p>Those haue not the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie who doe burne, 1. Cor. 7.9. To burne, or to be burnt, all doe not vnderstand alike: they of the Romish teaching holde that it is to commit fornication, that is (I take it) whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as though effeminatenesse, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domie, and such like, were no faults. The Apostle speaketh of a thing that few did take to bee a sin, many knew
<pb facs="tcp:14909:134"/>that fornication was: but he noteth the roote and originall therof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence of desire which few did know. Rom. 7. And sure it were verie strange, if onely before fornication the Apostle should preferre mariage, such an honourable ordinaunce of God, as was giuen in mans innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. To burne therfore, or to be burnt in the place before alledged is to be interpreted according to the vse of tongues and speech. Virgill saith of Dido: Wretched woman she is burnt, or burneth after Aeneas.</p>
               <p>Another sayth, that Cupids darts are dipt in fire. Earnest desires are meant so. Hos. 7.4. They are as an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen heated by the Baker. Paule spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more plainely. Rom. 1.27. They burned in lust one toward another. So is it taken here to bee burnt, or burne with lusts, which is, when a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath an vnconquerable armie of vnchast thoughts and desires in him, dishonouring him and his vessell.</p>
               <p>Thoughts and desires signifie all motions, many and oft: for seldome
<pb facs="tcp:14909:135"/>is any alone Vnchast are those which are not towards ones owne married companion. Vnconquerable they are, when they cannot be ouercome, but doe ouercome and make one yeeld to them: this one shall finde in himselfe, if he cannot with quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science liue in the feare of God, and discharge of his dutie: but these thoughts will possesse vs, they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable.

               </p>
               <p>Ob. But some may doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth and good name should be lesse then goods, because they are set after them.</p>
               <p>Ans. They are not, but farre to be preferred before them, and yet here set after, for that goods are necessary for life, truth, &amp; good name: for good and comfortable life: and therefore onely in that respect set behind. In this cōmaundement, beside the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, we must cōsider the thing, which is, <hi>bearing false witnesse against ones neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> This doth forbid: the thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden is <hi>false witnesse bearing:</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie against whom, is <hi>our neighbour.</hi> A partie whō you haue need of, or may vse, or who may vse, and haue need of you. Our English is, that we must not
<pb facs="tcp:14909:139"/>beare false witnes against such a one, as though only hurt to our neighbor hereby were forbidden. In Heb. it is <hi>Beth:</hi> which the learned know may be read as wel inward, or concerning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, or touching, &amp;c. so as not onely hurt is forbidden, but any falshood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way, of or to our neighbour. That which is translated, <hi>bearing,</hi> is in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, shalt not answere: that is shalt not say, or cause to bee said: so is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering in scriptures put for speaking Mat. 11.25. Pro. 15.1. A soft answer is a soft speech. False in the Hebrew, is of falshoode: implying that the party meaneth falsly. <hi>Witnesse:</hi> any shewing of any thing, as Ioh. 17.1. Cor. 15.15. This is said to be false, when it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth otherwise then the thing is in whole or in part. This witnesse is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things or persons, and so it is false generally: and specially.</p>
               <p>Generally it is false, when it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth otherwise then the hing is.</p>
               <p>Specially, it is false, when it witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth otherwise thē the person is: here therefore is cōmanded loue of truth,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:140"/>which by the light of nature the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could acknowledge. Truth is shewing a thing as it is: truth is an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertorie or promissorie. Assertorie of a thing present, or past: promissorie, of a thing to come.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Promise must be voluntarie.</p>

It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth publikly &amp; priuately: it must who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee told when occasion requireth, otherwise not. Not to tell the truth when one is called, though he say no falshood is to offend. Truth being commanded, the contrarie, viz. lying is forbidden, as Ephes. 4.25. Hos. 4.2. In a lie is:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Falshoode.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the knowledge of the speaker or vtterer, that it is false which is she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed: some say it is one thing to lie, an other thing to tell a lie. Tell a lie hee doth which telleth a falshood when he thinketh it is true: Lying is when
<pb facs="tcp:14909:140"/>one knoweth it false, and yet telleth it of purpose to deceiue.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Wherefore Parables, tales, as Esope Fables, Hyperbolies, Ironies, &amp;c. are no lies. Euerie kind of lie is forbidden.</p>

               <p>Quest. It may be said, that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen. 20.2. Isaak. 26.7. the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues. Exod. 1.19 Rahab. Iosh. 2.4. and others did lie.</p>
               <p>Ans. They might: wee must not looke what they did, but how well, and vpon what warrant: I take it, it was that these worthie personages fault that they so shifted for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14909:141"/>
               <p>Quest. But what may we thinke of stratagems, and deuises in warre, to beguile an enemie.</p>
               <p>Ans. They are lawfull, so they bee not by forsworne espials without ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: from an enemie in warre men looke for the worst, and all meanes of weakening force and craft are vsed. Nay God himselfe in the Scriptures teacheth vs to vse such deuises. We haue the more neede to strine against lying in our selues, for that we haue many prouocations thereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Our own lightnes &amp; corruption.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Too much respect of others.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Our owne pleasure and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Want of zeale for Gods glorie.</p>
               <p>We may bee discouraged from ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if we consider that wee ought to be earnest for Gods glorie: with the desire where of lying will not stand Iohn. 7. if wee thinke of daunger by lying: he that will lie, will easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare: Lying ouerturneth all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane societie, in that one cannot tell whome to trust: marke likewise how
<pb facs="tcp:14909:141"/>God punished lying in Ananias &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dhira, Acts. 5. Simō Magus: Gehezi. &amp; lying is of the Diuell. Thus much for false witnes against the thing: against the persō followeth, which is, against the good report of a partie. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of witnes touching a partie, we may consider our selues and others for getting good name and keeping of it: and first, for our selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ioyntly we may see what a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure good name is indeede aboue all outward thing may appeare, Eccl. 7. 2. Pro. 22.1. Whereby is declared that a good name is precious of worth in it selfe: and profitable, and of vse: it is profitable now, and after like sweete perfume presently refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, and preseruing against after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Now we are commaunded to procure things of good report, and for that who hath an euill name is halfe hanged, and will hardly euer recouer a good name againe, so as that hee is dissolute who careth not what others thinke of him: besides a good name is of great force to make
<pb facs="tcp:14909:142"/>our duties better accepted of others, and to drawe others more to Christ. And as the parties place is greater, so more care is to be had, for, and of, a magistrate and minister. But first wee must cōsider what good name is, that we may know the better how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. Good name is the witnesse of such as can well iudge of the giftes of God in one, well saide Aristotle, that honour was rather in the partie who honoureth, then in the partie that is honoured. Parties who will witnesse are the world: the godly, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: a mans owne conscience will. I say not that all are competent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, especially the worlde, in so much that Christ denounceth woe to such, whome all do praise, that is, the common worldlings, Luk. 6.26. Christ she weth it is impossible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue for them, who receiue honour one of another. Iohn. 5.44. being of the common sorte: so as that we are not to depend vpon the common voyce.</p>
               <p>Quest. But must a man therefore
<pb facs="tcp:14909:142"/>neglect witnesse from euill men.</p>
               <p>No, for Paul requireth witnesse of them who are without, 1. Tim. 3, 6.2. Cor 4.2. Our chiefe care must be that we giue them no iust cause to speake euill of vs, rather then if they speake to be much greiued for it: wee may keepe good reportes from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, so long as it is for our well doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which wee continue in and if it be witnessed by the godly, and God himselfe as well as by these: the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are such who are effectually called: these can best distinguish the grace of God: good witnesse from these is comfortable, euerie one iudgeth best the thinges hee knoweth: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse brothers sometimes will dissent, as Paul and Barnabas: Ierome &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten: this will somtimes execise one. God and a mans conscience remain, in whose witnesse for good, wee may more reioice then in all other besids. The things for which one hath good fame, are the giftes and graces of God: so as that all faultes and sinnes are to be remoued: it is disgrace to
<pb facs="tcp:14909:143"/>be praysed for a sinne: good name now thus set out, or as Iohn setteth it out, 3. Iohn 3.6. The witnesse of the bretheren to the truth, and the loue of the trueth to the partie: must we our selues, for our selues, first seek.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Rather doing the things which may deserue good fame, then seeking good fame barely for it selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Neuer seeking fame, but for the glorie of God, and greater good of others: to whome there by our giftes may bee the greater welcome and profitable.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Though we want fame from men, to haue alwaies witnesse from God, and our owne heart: this when we be dead shall be our credite: well then we may get good fame.</p>
               <p n="1">1 If we be wise, the memorial of the iust shall bee blessed, Psal. 10.7. And here we must take heed of secret sins: for which it pleaseth God sometimes to correct vs by suspitions, that go of vs, to hinder our good name: a man must take heed of small sins, they will bee increased if once they be spoken
<pb facs="tcp:14909:143"/>of: &amp; once spoken of, they will sticke long: occasions must be auoyded, he that will do no ill, must do nothing thereto: the worlde is giuen to make the worst of any thing in another.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If we be carefull to preserue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens good name, others will preserue ours.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Doe well and seeke not good fame, you shall finde it sooner: it is like your shaddow, the more you run after it, the lesse you catch it.</p>
               <p>Quest. But what if doing my best I cannot get a good worde?</p>
               <p>Ans. Examine your selfe, whether you haue not some sinne vpon you: open or secret: if you find you haue, seeke forgiuenes of the same, amend your fault, looke to your self for euer afterward. If vpon examination you find none, knowe that God is trying you, to know whether you wil cleaue to him: yea, or no, without good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte: and thinke that God may thus correct some former sinne in you, &amp; make you warie that you commit none afterwarde. This is for our
<pb facs="tcp:14909:144"/>selues, for others we get good report,</p>
               <p n="1">1 If we make them good.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If we take heede of such thinges as lessen good report: deedes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, so are sayings: as bewraying of secrets, infirmities, scoffes, whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, backbitinges, bitternesse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauing thoughts: as enuy, suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: taking things in euill part, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting euill thinges, dissembling or neglect of the gifts of God in others.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In excusing them who are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, so farre as wee may with good conscience.</p>
               <p n="4">4 In interpreting reportes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the best, burying some: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertising the partie, of whome they are thereof; that hee may looke to himselfe.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Hoping well of such as haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and are now turned and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we keepe their good reporte by the same meanes.</p>

               <head>The 10. Commaundement.</head>
               <p>Quest. Why, but do not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cōmandements intend thoughts and stirrings.</p>
               <p>Ans. Yes, but here of purpose God doth in speciall giue order for them that we should not pretend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ignorance, as our corrupt nature easily would.</p>
               <p>Quest. Againe it may be doubted, whether here bee two Commmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes or no: For that the verbe couet is twise repeated.</p>
               <p>Ans. It is but one onely, as Paule sheweth. Rom. 1.7. In this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, as before is contained, the person, and the thing. Thing forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is the coueting of that with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where the kinde of things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, is to couet the thing coueted <hi>house, wife, seruāt,</hi> &amp;c. of ones neighbor. Coueting, or desiring is naturall, or not naturall: naturall I call it which was in pure nature, as of meate and drinke for preseruation of nature,
<pb facs="tcp:14909:145"/>and this is not forbidden. Not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is that which though it arise from vs, yet was not in pure nature: which is not simplie forbidden, if it be with condition, if it bee with my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours liking: as if I wish to buy his horse at his owne reasonable price.</p>
               <p>Againe couetings or desirings, are diuerse, according to the occasions when they arise: some are occasioned without vs by diuels or men: other creatures whereto vnlesse consent do come they are not sinne: the diuell tempted Christ, hee resisted and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not.</p>
               <p>Others are occasioned from the roote of sinne: in our selues, these though the least are sins, these chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are here meant. The things, <hi>house, wife,</hi> &amp;c. signifie all other thinges whatsoeuer of our neighbours, these are named as most vsuall and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Paule setteth it out generally. Rom. 1.7. whom wee may most safely follow to finde out the meaning of this place, which is to condemne the
<pb facs="tcp:14909:145"/>imagination of the thoughts of mans heart. Gen. 6.5.8.21. which indeede are so by nature in all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>Neither is that speech more then plainly true. Gen. 6.5. as may appeare for that the like is repeated after the floud. Gen. 8.21. and is also repeated by Paul. Rom. 7.7. And though Noah be called iust, it was not for that hee was iust of himselfe, but by Gods speciall grace in forgiuing his sinne.</p>
               <p>This imagination is the first cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt naturall motion of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and will.</p>
               <p>It is in vs before and after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and is likewise sin: before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, it is called originall: after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, some diuines call it concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: this certainely after baptisme is, as the Romanists do not denie.</p>
               <p n="1">1 This is sinne, which most speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is noted in this commandement. Paul calleth this sinne. Rom. 7.8.9. so as one would meruell why the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of Trent should say, what it hath not the proper nature of sinne, as it
<pb facs="tcp:14909:146"/>doth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Besids it lusteth against the spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is a breach of the law, for by it one cannot loue God with all his heart, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Quest. But it is said out of Iames, 1.15. that lust, when it hath concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued bringeth forth sinne: and sinne when it is finished, bringeth forth death: as if concupiscence did not bring forth death, and so were no sin.</p>
               <p>Ans. That Iames meaneth actuall sinne, by the word sinne: concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in deede is no actuall sin, yet is it sinne for it is originall: besides Iames sheweth, ver. 14. that when a man is tempted he is drawne away by his owne concupiscence: that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away is from Gods law, and is a sinne: Wherefore Iames especially willeth to take heed of concupiscēce, because it draweth away, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out actuall sinne.</p>
               <p>Now this cursed mother, concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence: with her broode is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, these are:</p>
               <p n="1">1 Thoughts of thinges which
<pb facs="tcp:14909:146"/>should not bee, so as thought is not free by Gods lawe, though it may seeme by mans.</p>
               <p>Thoughts ought to be ordered wel, else they will rise from any thing. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard compareth thinges to a mill which presently as meale grind forth thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Dreames arising from concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
